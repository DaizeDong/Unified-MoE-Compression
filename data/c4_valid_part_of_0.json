        "text": "messaging system designed as a plugin-based system.\nDoubtless the kopete people would disagree with me here, but I'd say that their project was utterly redundant. What advantages does kopete bring that could not have been submitted to gaim itself? Why go to the time and effort to independently develop two programs which do virtually the same thing?\nNow there are other, significant differences. Gaim uses the GTK+ toolkit. Kopete uses Qt. Gaim is primarily C, Kopete is C++. In fact Kopete is fairly tightly bounded to KDE, whereas I think Gaim is not so quite involved with Gnome.\nSo we can reduce this redundancy problem to the problem of two desktops, if it is a problem. I'm not sure it is, after all competition is good and drives development. Is it that much of a problem that some coders have spent time and effort re-inventing the wheel anyway?\nWell I think it is a problem, unless you are heavily camped in either desktop. I'm not. When I develop a GUI application, I have to make a decision about which environment suits me best. I know there's more to it than that - Gnome has all that other stuff like Glib and KDE isn't just QT - but the GUI is a major consideration.\nSo if I opt for (say) GTK+, will some QT zealot prefer to code an alternative to using my version?\nI run a mixture of Gnome and KDE applications. I use Konqueror as a web browser, Gimp for some graphic stuff, etc. The two toolkits are somewhat annoying because they do not interact particularly well.\nWhen I write a GUI app, I want the interface code to be as separate from the logic as possible, to make swapping them in and out as easy as possible. Don't code an alternative, write a new interface for me!\nGlade is a GTK+ interface builder. You use a drag-and-drop program to compose a UI, and it can generate the corresponding GTK+ code. You can save the project seperately as an XML application.\nWhat is really exciting however is the companion libglade. This library reads in the XML that Glade writes at runtime and constructs the UI from that.\nYou therefore don't even need to necessarily use the UI builder to generate the XML if you don't want to. Perhaps you'll just translate a UI described in a different XML application.\nSo why do I think this is exciting?\nAlter/tweak the UI at runtime, without a recompilation.\nTranslate (via XSL) an interface description in a different XML application. I haven't looked at the design of the XML glade dialect much myself, it might be a nightmare; but at least that nightmare could be hidden behind a translation.\nWant a KDE version? Write a runtime, XML-interpreting UI builder for KDE!\nArgh! so this rant has gone off-track a little bit. What else have I got to cover?"

MEISNER, one of the prosperous and highly-esteemed business men of Birnamwood, Shawano county, was born in Newton township, Manitowoc Co., Wis., February 14, 1860, and is a son of Frederick and Magarette (Steltzer) Meisner, both natives of Germany.\nFrederick Meisner was born February 5, 1825, in Mechlenburg, Germany, and after the death of his father he, with his mother and the rest of the family, came to America in 1849, settling in Manitowoc county. Here the mother lived to the good old age, dying in 1888. The parental family comprised six children, namely John, Frederick, Joseph, Dora, Josephine and Mary. The mother of our subject was born in Bavaria about the year 1832. Her mother died in Germany, and about 1850 she came to America with her father and her three brothers; John, William and Nicholas—and three sisters—Mary, Cathrena and Lena. Her father was a farmer by occupation. Frederick Meisner had six children of whom Charles H., Frederick J. and Henry are living; William died when four years old; John when an infant, and a daughter, Bertha, when nine months old. This worthy couple at present reside on a farm purchased by Mr. Meisner some thirty-seven years ago, and which is situated near Manitowoc City. They are consistent members of the German Lutheran Church, and Frederick Meisner is a stanch Republican, although he has never taken a very active part in political matters.\nCharles H. Meisner was reared to the life of a farmer's boy, obtaining his education in the common schools, and assisting his father upon the farm until he was of age. He then spent several summers working upon a farm. In June, 1884, in company with John Roepke, he came to Birnamwood, where he bought out a store owned by Hunter and Cole, and organized the firm of Roepke & Meisner, proprietors of a general mercantile store. In 1889 they commenced the manufacture of lumber, buying and repairing a mill and furnishing employment to fifteen men, on an average. Both these gentlemen have built themselves handsome residences, and have dealt extensively in real estate, now owning some 1,300 acres of timber and farming lands. Charles H. Meisner was married January 4, 1884 to Miss Meta Pleuss, who was born in the same town and county as her husband. She is a daughter of Frederick and Mary (Levereriz) Pleuss, natives of Germany; who came to, America about 1850. The father; who was a farmer, died in 1877. They had a family of five daughters—Mary, Lizzie, Meta, Augusta and Minnie. Both the parents had children by former marriages. Mr. and Mrs. Meisner have no children.\nIn politics our subject is a good Republican, but has always been too busy attending to his own affairs to become an office-seeker. However, his fellow-citizens have shown their appreciation of his worth by making him town treasurer, and electing him to the minor offices. He was postmaster for eight years, and is one of the trustees of the village. He and his wife are members of the German Lutheran Church, and are held in high esteem."

The risk variant known as 1A(MTNR1A) gene basically turns off or on the DNA (through methylation). This is another fascinating epigenetic (a new field of genetics studying how our environment changes or genes) mechanism regulating function. The result people who can do this have less receptors and are not sensitive to melatonin and tolerate nights much better. The people with this gene variant can sleep in bright light without any difficulty as well.\nHmm all those years you wondered why you couldn’t stay awake at a night job and your peers seemed to have no problems.\nSleep is very complex and poorly understood."

        "text": "The sport of Bocce Ball is alive and well in Holliston.\n\"Throwing balls toward a target is the oldest game known to mankind. As early as 5000 B.C. the Egyptians played a form of Bocce with polished rocks. Graphic representations of figures tossing a ball or polished stone have been recorded as early as 5200 B.C. While Bocce today looks quite different from its early predecessors, the unbroken thread of Bocce’s lineage is the consistently common objective of trying to come as close to a fixed target as possible.\nFrom this early objective, the basic rules of Bocce were born. From Egypt, the game made its way to Greece around 800 B.C. The Romans learned the game from the Greeks, and then introduced it throughout the empire. The Roman influence in bocce is preserved in the game’s name; bocce derives from the Vulgate Latin bottia, meaning boss.\nThe early Romans were among the first to play a game resembling what we know as Bocce today. In early times they used coconuts brought back from Africa and later used hard olive wood to carve out Bocce balls. Beginning with Emperor Augustus, Bocce became the sport of statesman and rulers. From the early Greek physician Hippocrates to the great Italian Renaissance man Galileo, the early participants of Bocce have noted that the game’s athleticism and spirit of competition rejuvenates the body.\nIn 1576, the Republic of Venice publicly condemned the sport, punishing those who played with fines and imprisonment. And perhaps most grave was the condemnation by the Catholic Church which deterred the laity and officially prohibited clergyman from playing the game by proclaiming Bocce a means of gambling.\nBocce frequently lost and gained popularity throughout the ages. It was Giuseppe Garibaldi, who, while unifying and nationalizing Italy, popularized the sport as it is known today. In 1896, during a resurgence of popularity, the first Bocce Olympiad was held in Athens, Greece. Bocce has been a part of international sports ever since.\nThanks to many Italian immigrants at the turn of the century, Bocce has come to flourish in the United States. During its beginnings in the U.S., there were as many versions of the game as there were towns the immigrants had left. The popularity of Bocce in America has been on the rise since then and there are more than 25,000,000 Bocce enthusiasts throughout the United States today.\"\nNext to Soccer and Golf, Bocce is the third most participated sport in the world and is considered the oldest know sport in world history.\nAl Scaramella hosted the game that I attended. This day there were enough players to field two teams of four, one throwing red balls, the other green. Teams are determined as each player pulls a red or green ball out of a sack. Green always goes first.\nThe game starts with a member of the green team tossing out the Pallino, the small orange ball being thrown by Joe, above, who then rolls his green ball as close as he can to the Pallino. Red then tries to get closer to the Pallino than the green ball and each member of the red team rolls until a red ball ends up closest to the Pallino or all four reds are no closer than the green. Green gets to go again if a red ball ends up closer to the Pallino.\nAbove, the next ball to be thrown would be green since the red ball ended up closest to the Pallino. Capiche?\nAs in most sports, form is everything. Above Tony Alexander displays his form developed over years of playing bocce, starting \"when I was only this high\" said Tony with his hand waist high.\nHost Al Scaramella was just as effective using the same form as Tony. Both showed the results of years playing bocce.\nStrategy plays a big part in the game. Sometimes it's better to hit the ball of an opposing team than try to get close to the Pallino. The boards can also be used to position a ball behind the Pallino.\nAbove, Kevin tosses early in a game as Dennis, Tony, Aaron and Walter wait their turn. Tony and Al usually were anchors for their teams as it becomes important not to hit a ball of your same color and loose a point.\nSometimes a measurement has to be taken to determine which ball is closest. In the case above, one red ball is clearly closest but if the second red ball is closer to the Pallino than the green ball, then the red team gets two points instead of just one. Capiche?\nBetween games. Al Zambonis the court. Al built the court about four years ago and has been honing his skills ever since. Most remember when Bertuccis opened in 1984 or 85 with a Bocce court in the middle of the dining room. The court didn't last long for whatever reason.\nFirst team to reach 11 and is ahead by at least two points wins. This day the green team won every game even though there were different players each time.\nThere is at least one other Bocce court in Holliston. Teams and tournaments could lead to a shot at the Summer Olympics. Perchè no?\nI think this is fantastic. I played when I was a kid. Would love to be able to join a league in town.\nInteresting article, thanks. Would be great to see a bocce court installed at Blair Square near the rail trail!\n\"The court didn't last long for whatever reason.\"\nI think I should take some of the blame for the demise of the bocce court at Bertucci's. When it opened, my son was about 5. Bertucci's was a great place to take the kids (still is) and my son loved the bocce court, especially throwing the balls. His form wasn't as good as the pros, and occasionally, one of his throws went \"out of bounds\". I suspect there were other parents who failed at juggling waiting in line and making sure the balls stayed on the bocce court. Anyway, what goes around, comes around, and the offender is now 36, and expecting his first child in a few weeks."

Recently, India’s greenest airport terminal at Chandigarh international airport in Mohali was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nBuilt by Larsen and Toubro (L&T), the terminal, spread over 53,000 square meters, is designed in accordance with concept of green building. The terminal sets a new benchmark in sustainability by incorporating various green technologies.\nThe terminal is constructed using over 55 lakh fly ash bricks and features cavity walls, double insulated roofing, energy efficient chillers, and a sensor-based plumbing system to save water. Such an extensive use of fly ash in construction of large structure is highly commendable.\nThe terminal has achieved a 4-star GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) rating.\nUnlike other terminals, this does not have huge displays that run on artificial light and consume huge amount of electricity. Absence of displays has helped in cutting down maintenance costs and running expenditures.\nThe terminal does not require artificial lighting during day time owing to a transparent façade. Used glass on the façade is low-heat gain glass, which means it will automatically reduce the need for installing and spending on air conditioners.\nA lawn laid out right inside the terminal delivers a refreshing treat for passengers.\nThe available air conditioners are equipped with sensors that can detect body heat for automatic activation. Rest of the time, the ACs remain in sleep mode to save energy.\nTo meet the electricity requirements, a 200 KW solar plant is installed on the rooftop of the terminal. Solar plant generates enough energy to meet the major power needs of the building.\nFor lighting during nights, 40 percent of the airport is illuminated with energy-efficient LEDs.\nThe terminal also includes a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 600 KLD. The treatment plant is based on environment-friendly extended aeration technology. The recycled water is reused for flushing and gardening.\nThe airport terminal is one of its kind in India, may be in world too. It hasn’t received any name yet, but most likely it is to be named after Indian revolutionary freedom fighter Sardar Bhagat Singh. The new airport will facilitate neighboring states including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir."

It's really not that big of a deal, but I just feel bad there is nothing I can do to help, watching them wheel them away on the bed screaming, and then bringing them back asleep and waiting for them to wake up, which is never a pleasant thing if you have never experienced that.\nUnfortunately unlike Lucy he has had an infection that has been with him for a month, no antibiotic has cured it, not only that but the puss and fluid have not drained. So they will make an incision to let it drain before they put in the tubes the bad part is it's very painful, so the doctors tell me. Luckily Talmadge is a tough little boy, most of the time during his ear infections (9 since November) he never really cried, or woke up a lot at night, the only indication I ever has was a fever and loss of appetite. So hopefully he will not be to miserable when it's over.\nOh! How not fun! It never DOES get easier to see your kids cry because they are scared or hurt. But at least he won't remember it, and it will help him out a ton in the long (and sounds like short) run.\nPoor little guy! I can not even imagine what he must feel like. I hope it goes well and solves all the problems!\nGood luck girl! Let me know how things turn out. Wish I could be up there.\nSo nice to hear your Grandchild is having surgery on a blog spot!!\nDad told me or I still wouldn't know. So much for concerned parents/grandparents.\nAmber you poor thing could anything else happen...Knock on wood. Hey when you get a chance check my blog cause I pictured Tagged you. The rules are on the post. Good luck with all thats going on.\nAmber - I'm so sorry you have to go through this. Knock on wood, but I haven't had to see my kids go under anesthesia yet. Hang in there. I hope the tubes really help Talmadge!"

        "text": "Today we are delighted to introduce you to FarmGirlRosePetals, a three-generation family farm based in Oregon, growing gorgeous flowers and freeze drying the petals for eco-friendly celebrations!\nHow long have you been preserving flowers with freeze drying? When and where did the floriculture life begin for you?\nI started in 1988 in California… another business with my Mom & Sister. We were buying our flowers from local growers in Watsonville & also importing from South America. We wanted to find a piece of land and begin growing our own flowers so we would have 100% control over the quality of our products. That began our search which lasted for several years until we found our beautiful land.\nWhat (or who) inspired you to raise flowers and learn to preserve the petals?\nMy grandparents always had an incredible garden. I remember when I was a very young girl just how special it was to go through the white arch of the picket fence into the back gardens and what a special occasion it always was to have access to their gardens and to be there with them… gardening, harvesting flowers & the sweetest raspberries. My parents both loved gardening as well. The raising of flowers and the preservation of the petals came much later once we found our slice of paradise with our land here in Rainbow Valley, Oregon. Our property sits on the mighty South Umpqua River which is how we responsibly irrigate all of our flower fields using a drip irrigation system. This way, each crop receives the correct amount of water and none is wasted.\nDo you grow flowers other than roses?\nWe grow roses, hydrangea, peonies, lilacs… all of them are lovingly harvested by hand and carefully loaded into our specialized freeze-dry machines used to preserve the flowers and petals. Everything is done right here on our property… the growing, harvesting, processing and shipping. All done with positive energy and wonderful intentions.\nWhat do you enjoy most about the craft of drying rose petals for weddings and special events?\nHands down it is the joy of growing the flowers. We are so lucky to see this stunning beauty we create with Mother Nature’s help. We love all of the bees, the butterflies, lady bugs and the sweet floral scent that surrounds us on our land. Maybe even more importantly is how happy our flowers make all of our customers. We are so grateful for all the love they give back to us with glowing reviews, photos and more … they are incredible!\nWhat are some of the ways folks can incorporate your flower petals into their celebrations?\nThe uses for our petals are really unlimited. First thing that comes to mind is for a romantic celebration. Valentine’s day is a big one! They are used for proposals, engagement parties, save the date cards, weddings for creating or decorating the aisle, the guests to shower the blissful newlyweds with a petal toss when walking back down the aisle or for their first dance. To decorate the reception tables & couples honeymoon suite, include in thank you notes, gender reveals, babies first photos. They’re also used by resorts and hotels for rose petal turndown and spa services. We have many people that use them to honor and celebrate loved ones for memorials, funerals, celebration of life events. We have had people toss from helicopters, small planes, hot air balloons, military flyovers. Several natural soap, cosmetics and bath bomb companies incorporate our petals into their products. Party & home decorations, the Rose Parade every January. There are unlimited ways to include rose petals into your life… let your imagination have fun creating new ways to use them.\nWhere can your flower petals be purchased at this time?\nFreeze dried rose petals can be used in culinary projects. Have you ever done this?\nWe have made a number of items with our petals and so have many of our customers. The one that stands out the most is a company that uses our lilac petals in a special microbrew beer they blend. Now that’s creative!\nWhat resources do you find invaluable to the novice flower farmer? Do you have any tips for folks who might want to try freeze-drying their own rose petals from their gardens?\nFreeze drying utilizes highly specialized equipment which is very, very expensive. It is something you are able to do at home if you are willing to invest thousands of dollars for the small table top models. There are other methods of drying flowers, however, they will look like dried flowers verses fresh like freeze-dried petals and flowers look. Follow your heart, do what you are most passionate about. Experiment with plants, annuals, perennials, fruits & veggies… you just never know what will inspire and delight you until you try it!\nWe loved hearing more about your wonderful flower farm and, putting together this post, can almost smell the gorgeous flowers! Your farm is bringing joy to so many celebrations and that is something to celebrate, too.\nYou can keep up with Flyboy Naturals on their Facebook page at Flyboy Naturals Rose Petals and on on Instagram @flyboynaturalsrosepetals. And you can find FarmGirlRosePetals on Facebook, too.\nDo you have unique ideas for incorporating flower petals into celebrations? Share in the comments, we’d love to hear them!\nRose petals can add that special touch to just about any occasion, but when the celebration is over, you might be looking to sweep up those sweet blossoms. Solution? If you haven’t already purchased a farm-crafted, sustainably sourced broom from Little John… what are you waiting for? Sweeping up rosy rose petals is just one small task these mighty brooms are good at. And, since they last forever, there will be many more occasions where sweeping with a “piece of art” will bring you much joy!"

        "text": "Thymoquinone protects DRG neurons from axotomy-induced cell death.\nOBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a significant health problem that is linked to sensory, motor, and autonomic deficits. This pathological condition leads to a reduced quality of life in most affected individuals. Schwann cells (SCs) play a crucial role in the repair of PNI. Effective agents that promote SC activation may facilitate and accelerate peripheral nerve repair. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds, has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was investigated by using a laser microdissection technique in a mouse PNI model.\nMETHODS: Single cells were isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of 6-8-week-old mice, maintained in defined culture conditions and treated with or without TQ at different concentrations. Axons were cut (axotomy) using a controllable laser microbeam to model axonal injury in vitro. Under fluorescence microscopy, cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dyes. The behavior of the cells was continuously monitored with time-lapse video microscopy.\nRESULTS: TQ significantly increased neuronal survival by promoting the survival and proliferation of SCs and fibroblasts, as well as the migration of SCs. Furthermore, TQ improved the ability to extend neurites of axotomized neurons. The regenerative effect of TQ was dose-dependent suggesting a target specificity. Our studies warrant further preclinical and clinical investigations of TQ as a potential regenerative agent to treat peripheral nerve injuries.\nCONCLUSION: TQ exhibits a regenerative potential for the treatment of damaged peripheral nerves."

Also inspect the lift wire/guide to see if it is bent, corroded or catching on something, preventing the flapper from closing properly.\nThe float arm needs to be adjusted so that the water level is 2\" below the top of the overflow pipe. The float arm may need to be repositioned to obtain the desired water level. If it is a plastic float arm, adjust the screw located at the top of the arm. Also make sure the refill tube is located about 1/4\" over the overflow pipe. If necessary, clip the tube to the overflow pipe to stabilize it and keep it from moving into the overflow pipe.\nConsider replacing or repairing the service line to prevent larger loss of water. A professional service may need to be contacted for completing this task.\nAt this point, try to determine where the water is going inside the home.\nFinally, if all of the above tests show no evidence of leaked water, check the appliances that cycle. Water softeners can cause an increase in usage, so check the settings to make sure it is not cycling more often than necessary and monitor its full cycle to make sure it is operating properly. Also check outside spigots and hydrants to make sure they are not dripping, especially when connected to a sprinkler, soaker hose, or irrigation system.

Over the years I spent there we traveled to some of the countries you see highlighted in green. During these travels I saw the pyramids of Egypt, I summited Mt. Kilimanjaro, skied in the alps, learned how to scuba dive in Mauritius, and so much more. I was very lucky in this respect, but living in West Africa exposed me to some stark realities. I quickly came to understand that the world is a harsh place to most people. The struggle for survival is something real and a part of most peoples' everyday lives.\nIt wasn't until later, that I decided to travel again. This time on my own. At the age of twenty, fed up with the mundane routine of my life, I decided to take some time off school and head south. From my home in Colorado I traveled to Belize, Guatemala, and El Salvador. I was interested in environmental science, ecology, and societies different from my own and this area of the world beaconed me.\nI fell in love with the culture, the people, fellow travelers and the Spanish language. I spent just a few months down there, but I left with a promise to return. After just a couple years I graduated with a degree from Colorado State University, and I fulfilled that promise. It's now been over three years of traveling and I am still living the transient life, as a writer, traveler, and outdoor guide.\nWhere will I be going next?\nThe concept of Tramp-N-Trekker is simple, its a blog about the intersect between outdoor enthusiasm and a loose footing lifestyle. Covering a wide range of topics like the cost of living abroad, backpacking meals, gear reviews, travel tips, musings from the vagabond lifestyle and my personal thoughts on all related matters. This is meant to be for anyone who wants to travel, regardless of location or duration. It is meant to inspire people to travel while offering the tips and tricks I've acquired from doing so myself. During my travels I will be backpacking into the mountains, forests and jungles of the world. Exploring iconic cities and small villages alike. Meeting new people, and doing whatever else comes my way."

        "text": "A PROCEDURE assessed by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and used in research led by the University of Birmingham has been hailed as an exciting development in increasing the number of livers which can be safely used for transplantation.\nLiver transplantation is a highly successful treatment for end-stage liver disease, which kills 11,000 people a year in England. Deaths from liver disease have soared by 25 per cent in a decade and continue to rise, while the average age of death from liver disease (currently 50-59 years) continues to decrease.\nToday NICE has issued final guidance which recommends the procedure — ex-vivo machine perfusion for extracorporeal preservation of livers for transplantation — is used under special arrangements as more data is gathered into its efficacy.\nNICE’s independent advisory committee did not identify any major safety concerns.\nNHS England and commissioners will decide whether they fund the procedure. However research is already taking place at centres around the UK including studies by experts from the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Liver and Gastrointestinal Research in the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre.\nUniversity of Birmingham Honorary Professor Darius Mirza, Consultant Transplant Surgeon at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said: “In the 30 years I’ve been involved with transplantation there have been three or four events which have been game changers and I’m absolutely certain we are looking at a game changer that will change the way we practice organ storage and transplantation.\nSue Bennett, 45, a mother of three from Ranton in Staffordshire, had a liver transplant using this new technique in 2015.\nShe said: “I signed up for the trial not knowing I would be one of the first to have this procedure in the country. Before my transplant I was very ill. I was losing weight, I couldn’t sleep and my quality of life was quite low.\n“Having a transplant has changed my life. I‘ve joined the gym, got fit and gone back to work and did some voluntary work for the Staffordshire Search and Rescue team and I also compete nationally and internationally in the Transplant Games as a member of the Team GB transplant team.\nJohn Forsythe, associate medical director at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “There has been a huge amount of research in the area of preservation and perfusion methods that allow us to both assess precious donor organs and to enhance their function. This could potentially mean the organ works better and improve transplant outcomes.\n“Many of the lead researchers in the area of transplant preservation and perfusion techniques are in UK and it is good to see UK researchers continue to be at the forefront in this field.\nVanessa Hebditch, director of policy at the British Liver Trust said, “Every year hundreds of people with advanced liver disease die whilst waiting for a transplant.\n“This new device offers real hope as it may improve transplant outcomes and allow livers that were previously thought to be unsuitable to be used and also increase the time that livers are able to be kept.\nFor the financial year ending 31 March 2018, there were 1,043 liver transplants in the UK and 359 patients on the UK active transplant list, according to NHS Blood and Transplant.\nThe number of patients on the active transplant list reached a ten year high in 2015 when 611 patients were on the waiting list. However the large drop attributed to the 2018 figure may be due to the introduction of the National Liver Offering Scheme (NLOS) in March 2018."

Focusing on extreme conditions, Wheeler has illustrated more than a half a dozen weather-related titles written by Lorraine Jean Hopping. Included in the series are Wild Weather: Blizzards, which combines historical incidents involving blizzards with facts about these massive storms and descriptions of the job of a meteorologist. Wild Weather: Lightning! includes facts about the study of lightning and its potential deadly consequences, with many maps and illustrations. Booklist's Ilene Cooper called the watercolor artwork in Wild Weather: Blizzards \"effective.\"\nWheeler has also teamed up with author Rosemary Wells to produce a series of books for preschoolers, with Wheeler providing the interior artwork. In Read Me a Story, little kitten Yoko knows how to read but does not tell her mother for fear that she will stop reading to her. Yoko's ability comes from a decoder ring she sent for. Finding out about Yoko's talent, the mother assures the kitten that she will keep reading to her, and, in fact, allows Yoko to read to her. School Library Journal critic Anne Knickerbocker said of Wheeler's artwork, \"Each page sports a bright, color illustration that will aid beginning readers in decoding the text.\"\nWheeler once told SATA: \"I developed a greater than average interest in children's books at an early age, having been influenced and encouraged by my great-aunt Opal Wheeler, a prolific writer of books for young readers in the 1950s. After being trained as a fine artist and art educator, I moved to Manhattan in 1977, and eventually turned to the field of publishing. I worked as a design assistant/secretary at Dial Press in the juvenile books division for two years before establishing my own freelance illustration business in 1980. Since then, I have enjoyed working on a variety of projects ranging from picture books to educational texts and magazines, greeting cards to coloring books.\"\nBooklist, May 15, 1999, Ilene Cooper, review of Wild Weather: Blizzards!, p. 1705."

        "text": "Cluster comprises IBM's Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nIBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.s 64-bit Opteron processor.\nIBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server—which targets scientific and technical computing users—with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nThe new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBMs eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the companys BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.s 32-bit Xeon chips.\nClusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputing environment for users. In a related move, IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers.\nIBMs 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBMs Deep Computing unit.\n\"For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice—you either run 32-bit or 64-bit—Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,\" Turek said. \"Its an attractive proposition.\"\nAMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opterons ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intels Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software.\nWith the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the companys IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running.\nOn Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including Red Hat Inc. and SuSE Linux AG, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings.\n/zimages/3/28571.gifRead \"MS Delay Hinders Itanium Software Upgrade.\"\nGordon Haff, an analyst with Illuminata Inc., said Opterons adoption path is mirroring that of the older Itanium technology.\n\"Theres a lot of interest in Opteron in [the high-performance computing space]; its nearly exclusively in HPC,\" said Haff, in Nashua, N.H. \"Its a good performing chip, and thats pretty much what HPC [customers are] looking for.\"\nWhile backward compatibility with 32-bit applications may make Opteron more attractive in the commercial space, HPC users are more interested in performance, he said.\nTurek agreed. \"The Intel name carries a lot of weight in the industry,\" he said. That said, HPC and technical computing customers tend to be among the early adopters of new technology.\n\"Theyre searching for the best technology without so much regard for the brand,\" he said.\nThe Opteron cluster offering includes IBM Cluster Management Software, which aims to avoid problems and speed up the resolution of problems that do occur by automating repetitive tasks and error detection.\nAlso included in the cluster package is a new Linux Cluster Install Tool, which automates much of the installation work, IBM officials said.\nIn the supercomputing interconnect project, Cornings Science & Technology Division, in Corning, N.Y., will create a prototype for an optically switched interconnect. IBM Research Labs in the United States and Switzerland will build the systems electronic control and monitoring circuitry."

The Yacht Club is on the wind protected left side of the big bay, the rest of the shoreline looks like Miami, or Ft. Lauderdale, or Puerto Vallarta. Our first impression was to get what we needed and get out. It was crowded boats on the hook, mooring balls, and a lot of crap tied around the area. We found the marina and fuel docks, met with the management of the thing to get permission to buy some fuel and did just that. They didn’t even have any potable (drinking) water at the dock. (so they said). Turns out it is harder than you would think to find potable water from a hose. Normally, there is drinking water accessible via a water hose just like you have attached to your house. There isn’t a fee for the water since you are purchasing fuel. But we found that once we left Puerto Vallarta, we couldn’t find water until we were so far south that we were almost to Guatamala. The snooty factor in Acapulco is about a 9 on the 10 point snooty scale.\nDidn’t even drag a camera out.\nAcapulco helds no interest for us…so goodbye Acapulco."

Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing.\nAlmost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area.\nGovernment agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property.\nMost government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment. In many cases, agencies can only buy from certain suppliers or can only buy goods within specific price ranges. Agencies often hire purchasing agents with marketing backgrounds to help them manage their purchases, including setting criteria for suppliers and establishing price ranges. Government purchasing agents must be very familiar with current purchasing regulations at their agency.\nLocal, state and federal agencies sometimes sell bonds to finance capital improvement projects in their jurisdictions. These agencies hire bond and securities marketing specialists to prepare bond prospectuses for investors, which detail the terms of the bond, and to organize marketing campaigns to sell the bonds. Bond marketing specialists also typically manage media relations for bond campaigns.\nBrowne, Clayton. \"Are There Marketing Jobs in the Government?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/there-marketing-jobs-government-22921.html.

What can I do?\nTo fix this it needs to implement a few permissions to wine and it should be installed to external storage. Temporary - until the next wine will be published - it can be done using some apk-editor/modification-utility through adding those permissions manually to the manifest. Also create some new folder on /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/. Call this folder \"org.winehq.wine\" and add in there another folder like \"drive_z\".\nUse a sophisticated file-manager to connect the wine-app with the \"org.winehq.wine\"-folder and create the connection to drive_z, i.e. \"Z:\\\" through wineconfig.\n4. permission to mount/unmount filesystems.\nGood Morning. I have the same problem. It says \"Access Denied\" every time I want to execute an .exe file. I am a root user and I have tried to modify the permissions with applications like \"total commander\" but I did not succeed.\nI thank you for helping us. Excuse my English, I'm from Argentina, I speak Spanish. Can you be a little clearer? I do not understand why I do not handle my English very well. Thank you!\nHello, I am new to this forum. I've been able to modify the app manifest to install on the sd card, grant read/write permission, and mount/unmount file systems. I couldn't quite find the other permissions that were suggested. Also, do you mind elaborating on how to do this? Or which app could be used to do so?\nThanks! But it finally makes sense now. \"Access denied\" must come up whenever trying to run a program that isn't compiled for ARM. I was able to copy and paste the wine iexplorer.exe file into my phone's Download folder, and it ran fine from there. Now the hard part is finding .exe files that will actually work on a snapdragon SoC."

This is an award that’s given to new bloggers as a way to recognize & encourage them in their work.\nAyanna over at 21 Flavors of Splendor has nominated me for this award, and I couldn’t be more grateful. I’ve been following Ayanna, pretty much since I started blogging. She’s always been encouraging and this nomination is just further proof of that. Head over to check out her blog, oh and her Instagram is one full of encouragement and fun peaks into her everyday!\nAnother blog that I really love is Rachael’s over at Oh Lord Help Us. This is a woman sharing her faith and sharing her resources. It’s clear from the moment you enter the world of her blog, she’s looking to be real, have real conversation, and share her real learning. In addition to her blog, she’s also making some pretty sweet jewelry pieces. And as if that weren’t enough, she’s donating the proceeds from sales to invest back in her ministry to share Gods truth with woman of faith to know who they were created to be. This is a ministry and blog that will encourage women to live to their full potential as strong and fierce daughters of God. Check her out over at her blog, Instagram or any of her social media accounts. She’s always dishing out some encouragement.\nThe rules of this nomination encourage each blogger to share some randomness about ourselves. This is such a fun way to get to know each other a little better. So here we go!\nI often make myself giggle. I’m the funniest person I know. Kidding..a little!\nI’ve watched “The Office” and embarrassing number of times, I could probably quote the entire series.\nMy family and I speak fluent movie quotes…it keeps things interesting!\nI typically eat all the snacks after my kids are asleep, then claim to have no idea what happened to them. NO SELF CONTROL!\nSome more encouraged fun is answering questions from the person who nominated you, and posing 10 of your own for your nominations to answer on their website. Ayanna asked some really good ones, check them out below.\nI started blogging as a creative outlet. At first, I was into the thrill of learning the in’s and out’s of the process. Then I realized, I had a voice, actual things to say that could help others. This is why I continue to blog.\nThe name of my website perfectly describes the main themes of my life. We’re a family totally dependent of God’s grace to make it through the struggles of everyday life. Giggling is how we keep sane!\nItaly, definitely Italy! Or maybe Main, I hear they have the most amazing Autumn seasons.\nWhat is your favorite fiction book?\nIs it bad that I don’t have one? I’m not much of a reader. Lately my reading is mostly of other’s blogs. I’ve been learning so much from my blogging buddies, and have gained new perspectives.\nNew friends! Admittedly, I’m not a social media person at all. In fact before my blog, I had almost no presence on any of it. Since I started blogging, I’ve made many friends all around the globe and have joined in prayer, joys, and sorrows with them.\nIf you could meet any person, who is still alive, who would it be and why?\nI had to really think about this one, but here’s who I came up with…ANY MISSIONARY. I know that God has me tethered to my current place, so I often look in amazement at folks who are picking up and moving out all in an effort to further the Kingdom of heaven and help as many people as possible. It’s a pretty interesting calling and life to lead.\nCoffee & my Bible. I know that’s two things, but it measures up to one good morning.\nIf you could eat one food every day and not worry about the calories, what would it be?\nIce cream, with tons of stuff in it. I love stuff, any stuff, in my ice cream!\nWhat do you see happening on your blog in year 5?\nI’ve started praying for God to use my website as a way to lift others, and to connect a body of of like minded people to encourage each other and share life stories. I’m letting God lead me at this point, I’m willing to turn in any direction He leads me to.\nWhat’s your favorite activity (outside of blogging, of course!)?\nWhat’s the one T.V. show that you hope(d) never goes (went) off the air?\nIf you were to start a charity, who would it benefit?\nAre you a morning person? If so, please help me with some tips!\nWhat’s one piece of advice you can give to new bloggers?\nWhat’s you favorite social media platform?\nWhat are some goals you have for your website?\nLadies, I’m so excited to read all the answers to these questions! Have fun with your answers.\nThank you again to Ayanna, who gave me this opportunity to not only share more about myself, but to keep this recognition train rolling.\nThank the person who nominated you, and post a link to their blog on your blog.\nDisplay the award on your blog — by including it in your post, or by having it as the feature image.\nWrite a 150-300 word post about your favorite blog that is not your own. Explain why you like the blog, provide links.\nProvide 10 random facts about yourself.\nAnswer the questions from your nominator.\nNominate 5 – 11 blogs that you feel deserve the award, who have less than 200 followers.\nAsk your nominees questions of your own.\nJesus really is the reason-Sorry Santa!\nWelcome to this space on the world wide web I’ve carved out for faith, family, food & funnies. Here I’m sharing all the things that bring me joy.\nI didn’t always know God, but this much I do know, He’s always been with me. I’m so sure that God intended for us to share with each other for the sake of community & encouragement.

This fusion makes the spine less flexible and can lead to a curved posture forward. When the ribs are touched, it can be difficult to breathe deeply. Ankylosing spondylitis affects men more than women. Signs and symptoms usually begin in early adulthood. Inflammation can also occur in other parts of the body, most often in the eyes. Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be cured, but treatments can reduce their symptoms and possibly delay the progression of the disease. It is a type of arthritis which especially affects the spine. Mostly men at their teen age get attack by this disease.\nIts actual causing reason is still unknown. But it is hypothesized that some genes like HLA-B27 may be responsible for developing this disease."

From December 1 to December 12, citizens can donate items in their own neighborhoods or at local participating businesses to help neighbors in need.\nThe Food Elves is a charitable community service group made up of more than 60 students ranging from elementary through high school. For the past two years they have joined forces with the Franklin Downtown Partnership to operate the “12 Days of Donating” campaign with great success. This year the Elves aim to beat last year’s record-breaking collection drive by raising more than $5,700 and 4,200 pounds of goods.\nAccording to the Food Pantry, about 600 households are registered to use Pantry services. This year’s need will be even greater due to a decrease in SNAP benefits in November. Health and hygiene items are not covered by those benefits and are a particular need.\nIn early December, Food Elves will notify their neighbors about the collection campaign, including what items can be collected and the collection dates. Residents simply place bags of goods at their mailboxes on the designated pickup day and the Elves will do the rest. Collection dates will be Saturday, December 7, Sunday, December 8, or Saturday, December 14.\nIn case there’s no Elf in your neighborhood, it is still easy to donate. The Elves have placed bright red collection bins at participating Downtown Partnership member businesses. If the Elves meet their goal of collecting more than 1,200 pounds of goods, each business has pledged to donate $200. There will be a donation bin at the Holiday Stroll tree lighting ceremony at Dean College on Thursday, December 5, or you can drop off donations at the Food Pantry, 43 West Central St., and designate them for the “12 Days of Donating” drive.\nDCU, 500 West Central St.\nDean Bank, 21 Main St.\nEmma’s Quilt Cupboard, 12 Main St.\nFranklin Downtown Partnership Office, 9 East Central St.\nJane’s Frames, 11 East Central St.\nMurphy Business, 15 East Central St.\nPour Richard’s Wine & Spirits, 14 Grove St.\nColin and CJ Berg; Gabbie Blood; Malik, Hatim, Suhail and Nasir Brahimi; Julia and Katie Buccella; Cara and Chris Callahan; Sarah Carroll; Austin and Carter Castillo; Avery and Erin Chalk; Allie Champlin; Gillian Cristiano; Karen Cunningham; Jacob and Julia Dextradeur; Ryan Dombroski; Brendan Donaghey; Jamie Dragsbaek; Adam Duval; Kaleigh, Abby, Megan and Maddie Egan; Griffin and John Fenton; Haley Frank; Megan Georges; Alexa Katsaros; Maddie Lacman; Nicolette McCarthy; Kyle Neenan; Connor O’Brian; Cameron Piana; Dylan, Kaitlyn, Lindsey and Sydney Rappa; Ashley and Taylor Reutlinger; Sara Richardson; Aubree, Cassi and Corey Ronan; Abby, Chloe and Cooper Ross; Emily Shea; Jake Signo; Cam and Evan Strouse; Ellie and Katie Teixeira; Ben and Dan Weiss.\nFor more information about the Franklin Food Elves and the “12 Days of Donating” campaign, please contact the Franklin Downtown Partnership at (774)571-3109 or downtown.franklin@yahoo.com.

        "text": "Editor’s note: The Consulate General of Belgium in Atlanta each month puts out a newsletter recounting its activities across the region and informing its compatriots about vital information from the foreign ministry. Follow the consulate on Facebook.\nAs with each edition, this month’s included a spotlight on Belgian living and working in the consulate’s jurisdiction. Known as “The Belgian in the Picture,” the series aims to show just how deeply impactful the country’s economic and cultural engagement with the South is, despite its small size. The below Q&A is reprinted with permission and has been lightly edited for clarity and style.\nBelgian Consulate: Paul De Sloover, a veteran Belgian entrepreneur in the U.S., is being spotlighted in this month’s newsletter — appropriated given that his latest venture provides an innovative way to generate power from the sun. Mr. De Sloover, can you tell us more about the solar roof tiles made by Desol Power Tiles?\nMr. de Sloover: Solar roof tiles are roof tiles with integrated solar panels. Instead of installing unsightly solar panels on top of an existing roof, with DeSol Power Tiles it is your roof itself that captures the sunlight. The tiles themselves look like regular classic Nordic style roof tiles, and when installed as instructed they form a completely sealed, walkable and hurricane-resistant roof.\nBelgian Consulate: What are other reasons more people are choosing solar roof tiles rather than solar panels?\nMr. de Sloover: An issue a lot of people run into when they consider turning to solar energy, is that most home owners’ associations don’t accept the looks of large solar panels. Because our solar roof tiles don’t affect the aesthetic or architectural appeal of the roof, it removes that hurdle entirely.\nBelgian Consulate: With 31 years of experience as an entrepreneur in the U.S., what is your favorite aspect of doing business here?\nMr. de Sloover: I would have to say the easy access to people and institutions, and the willingness of people to inform and help you in what you want to realize. And, of course, the advantages of the sheer size of the market and having unified regulations in that one big market. That is a definite advantage compared to Europe where every country has different regulations regarding solar roof tiles.\nBelgian Consulate: What would you tell a budding Belgian entrepreneur dreaming of taking his chances in the U.S.?\nMr. de Sloover: Don’t dream, act. America, the United States, is a very open country. Spend time going to business fairs and talking to professional people. Do not assume that what works in Belgium will work in the States. Do your research.\nBelgian Consulate: How do you see the future of eco-friendly energy in the US?\nMr. de Sloover: At this point there are two different schools of thought. Part of the people want to keep everything the way it is, and the other group of people wants renewable energy. Recent polls show that 73 percent of the American population believes in renewable energy. It will take time to get there, because this country, the United States, has an abundance of fossil fuels in its soil. But it also has an abundance of sunshine. So I would say, the future is bright."

        "text": "CompactFlash cards are not very popular anymore as Secure Digital cards are typically much cheaper. That being said, pro-sumer Digital SLR cameras as well as full Professional SLR cameras use CompactFlash as it seems to be more reliable and is certainly faster when it comes to continuous write speeds. Today we are taking a look at a very expensive 16GB card from SanDisk that is from their flagship line – the Extreme Pro. These cards claim to have a write speed of up to 90MB/sec – making them some of the fastest flash cards to ever hit the general public. How much will this set you back? SanDisk lists the MSRP at a mere $335.99USD currently. Before you choke and run away, let’s take a look and see if this price tag is justified in any way, shape or form.\nFounded in 1988 by Dr. Eli Harari, an internationally recognized authority on non-volatile memory technology, SanDisk has grown to become the world’s largest supplier of innovative flash memory data storage products.\nSanDisk currently has more than 1,100 U.S. patents, more than 600 foreign patents, and more than 1440 patent applications pending in the U.S. SanDisk is the only company, worldwide, that has the rights to both manufacture and sell every major flash card format, including CompactFlash®, SD™, miniSD™, microSD™, MultiMediaCard™, Reduced Size MultiMediaCard (RS-MMC™), Memory Stick PRO™ and related Memory Stick® products, xD-Picture Card™ and USB flash drives.\nSanDisk became a publicly traded company (NASDAQ:SNDK) in November 1995, and in 2008 revenues were 3.3 billion. With more than 3,400 employees worldwide, SanDisk is headquartered in Milpitas, California.\nMy interest in a fast CompactFlash card was recently piqued when I picked up a Nikon D300s DSLR. This card uses both SD and CF media and you can specify which picture format gets stored on each card. Normally I take pictures and save them lossless as RAW (NEF) as well as JPG. I love the convenience of the Eye-Fi SD card for uploading my pictures to Flickr and to my computer and it is nice to have all the RAW files stored on a separate card. The problem is that each RAW image is over 9MB and the camera takes up to 8FPS with a battery grip. It doesn’t take long to fill the buffer and start slowing the camera down.\nThe Extreme Pro series of CompactFlash cards come in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB capacities and can cost you almost $900 for the 64GB version. These cards are not for the weak of heart, but they do offer a nice bunch of features.\nThe following information has been pulled from the SanDisk product page and posted here for your convenience.\nNow there’s a memory card fast enough to keep up with your advanced DSLR: The SanDisk Extreme® Pro™ CompactFlash® card. With lightning-fast (up to 90 MB/s* read/write) speed, you’ll be able to capture more continuous burst shooting-and get the most out of your professional digital SLR camera. And with up to 64GB** of storage, you’ll be ready for more RAW+JPEG and high-def video.\nSanDisk engineered its Power Core™ Controller to take whatever your camera’s buffer can dish out. By distributing image data across the card more rapidly and efficiently, this card delivers professional performance.\nPOWER CORE CONTROLLERTM & ENHANCED SUPER-PARALLEL PROCESSINGTM “ESP”: Was invented by SanDisk to increase the card’s performance level.\nOn the next page we’ll take a look at this cards performance in our camera and on our computer.\nFor this review we used the speedy Addonics ADSACF-N SATA CompactFlash card reader . This device supports UDMA enabled CompactFlash cards and is about the fastest CompactFlash card reader we could get our hands on with short notice. Some Firewire 800 card readers are available as well and they should certainly push the limits of this card. As previously mentioned, we also used a Nikon D300s DSLR camera that shoots in continuous mode at 7FPS with the built-in battery and up to 8FPS with the additional MB-D10 battery pack. For this review we used the MB-D10 battery grip in order to push the limits of this card.\nFor comparison in both HDTach as well as the actual camera tests, we compared the SanDisk Extreme Pro 600x card with an affordable Lexar 8GB 80x card. Obviously the difference should be obvious, but it is interesting to see how much difference there is in the real world.\nWhile the Extreme Pro supports UDMA 6 (Ultra ATA/133), the Addonics Card Reader only supports UDMA 5 (Ultra ATA/100). This is still faster than any built-in USB card reader on your laptop or desktop computer and HDTach should show some interesting performance.\nWe start things off with a look at HDTach and compare the Lexar 8GB 80x card against the SanDisk 16GB 600x card. As you can see read performance is taken care of by the SanDisk card. It doesn’t come close to its 90MB/sec speed, but it does burst to over 67MB/sec and averages 34.6MB/sec read speed. Compare this to the Lexar card which bursts to 15.9MB/sec and averages a 15.6MB/sec read speed.\nWith those numbers in mind, we popped these cards into the D300s and started clicking. We shot images in bright daylight at 1/200 shutter speed at ISO100, with no noise reduction. The Tokina 11-16mm lens was set at f2.8 and we ran through a couple of tests. The first test was to see how fast the camera could fill the buffer and once it was full, we’d take two more frames to get our first result. In RAW mode, the images at 4288×2848 and were averaging about 9.28MB in size. The SanDisk card shot 20 images in exactly 3 seconds. The buffer filled at about 18 images and we snapped a couple more for a realistic result. The Lexar card started out pretty good, but when the buffer filled, it slowed down to a crawl as it couldn’t write data very fast. We took 19 images in 5 seconds with this card.\nOnce we did the initial speed test, we timed out how long it took to take 30 images. Once again we started out with the SanDisk Extreme Pro and we took 30 images in 5 seconds flat. That works out to six images per second – including the time it take to write to the card once the buffer is full. The Lexar card took 19 seconds to snap the same 30 image set. The first 17 were very fast, but the next images were painfully slow.\nThe above information doesn’t really indicate actual write speed as the camera buffer is holding 17 images and writing as fast as possible. The reality is that you can continue to shoot 5 images per second while the SanDisk card is writing data and the Lexar card takes over a second to write a single image. The Lexar card is more than 6x slower in the real world.\nWhile I’m sure that most people wouldn’t consider spending $250+ on a 16GB CompactFlash Card, if you’re a budding photographer and you just have to capture that action shot to get your big break, the SanDisk Extreme Pro card won’t leave you waiting. It writes incredibly fast, reads data from the card in a snap and worked flawlessly through the weeks that we pounded this card in our tests. We used it in low temperatures -10C without issues and I’m confident that this card will keep on kicking long after your SD cards have corrupted. In the D300s, I used it to record my RAW images and sent the JPEGs to an SD card and this convenience and performance is fantastic.\nThe bottom line is this: “Would I spend $250 on this card?” I wish I had $250 to spend on it as it gives you the freedom to shoot as much as you need to without worrying about slowing down your camera considerably while the card writes images from the buffer. The performance you gain from this card is remarkable – if you have a fast camera – but you’ll have to decide if the performance is worth the price. This makes it hard to score value – as it is extremely expensive for 16GB of storage, but for the speed it is priced not too badly.\nIf you’re even considering this card, you probably have over $2000 worth of camera kit hanging around your neck and this would only represent about 10% of your investment. If you look at it that way, it’s probably not a bad buy."

        "text": "Welcome to Boston Mamas Rock! – where we’re giving a voice to fabulous local mamas from all walks of life. Read on for today’s interview with Susan Dorson & Amy Weitzman, two local moms on a mission to save their community library and provide parents with an eco-friendly, affordable shopping option via The Little Fox Shop. Then go ahead and nominate yourself or a friend!\nChristine: Welcome, Susan and Amy! You were nominated for this feature because of the work you have done to start The Little Fox Shop at the Edith Fox Branch Library in East Arlington, where all proceeds go to support the library (whose doors have been on the verge of closing for some time due to budget cuts). Now, everyone (present company included) talks about the importance of preserving local libraries, but your efforts truly walk the walk. What inspired you to action to help save the Fox Branch?\nSusan: I have always loved the Fox Library but when I was pregnant with my first son, I would take daily walks up to the Fox and chat with the librarians and it became a part of my life. After my son was born, there were days when I was very lonely but I knew that my local library was a place I could find people to talk to - and of course books. The thing about a branch library is that it is more than just a place to get books; it is a community gathering place. Owing in part to the smaller population that the Fox serves, you can see the same faces each week, you can network and go to events, and it becomes central to your life. I couldn't see this taken away from me, my children, or my neighborhood. The main branch is wonderful but to be able to walk into a place and have everybody know your name....well, that's special.\nAmy: When Susan asked me be to part of a new children's secondhand store inside the library, I didn't hesitate to join her. I have always loved libraries and seriously considered becoming a school librarian a few years ago, but was disheartened when I saw that librarian positions were being eliminated at many schools around the country. Running the shop to save my local library seemed like the next best thing to me. Susan informed me that Arlington elementary schools no longer have librarians. The Fox Library will be the best way for my children to access the wealth of knowledge that librarians have on children's books and reading. That really motivated me. Also, the recycling aspect of the Little Fox is tremendously important to both Susan and me. When you buy a recycled item from the Little Fox instead of new from another store, the earth smiles.\nChristine:How difficult was it to get this effort going? What was the rough timetable from conception to opening? Did the town of Arlington help with startup funds to spruce up the space and get your website going or was it all pieced together through friends and family? Some combination of both?\nSusan & Amy: Getting the Little Fox started took a lot of thinking and planning. The time from conception to opening was about 8 weeks. One of our most important goals was to create an atmosphere in which people would enjoy shopping and volunteering. We didn't receive any funds from the town, but they gave us the space and free reign over it. Almost nothing in the shop was purchased new. One of us would spy a good shelf on the curb for trash and haul it over to the shop. We would have \"pizza night\" at the store and our husbands and children would come and they would play while we worked. Friends would come with us to the shop and help us get ready for the opening as well. Susan has a really good eye for store design and has done most of the arranging and decorating of our physical space. Amy worked in advertising and software development before she had children, so she was able to create our website and organizes our online schedule of volunteers. Our different skill sets compliment each other very well.\nOne of the inspirations for the Little Fox was the PTO Thrift Store, which operated in the basement of the Fox Library for four years. It was a great success and many people in Arlington were sad to see it closing. They sold anything and everything, but we love and need kid stuff and decided to focus exclusively on children's items. We opened the same month the PTO Thrift Store closed, and they generously gave us many of their racks and shelving. Also, the librarians at both the Fox and Robbins Libraries have been wonderfully helpful and supportive.\nChristine: What used to live in the space where The Little Fox shop now resides? Did you take before and after photos? From a design perspective, what transformed the space from (presumably) dingy storage space to what your nominator called a “hip thrift shop”?\nSusan & Amy: The space most recently held the Arlington Early Intervention program, which moved about a year ago. I don't think we have any before pictures, but it wasn't very appealing when we took over the space. While we wanted to repaint the entire space, that was one thing were weren't allowed to do, so it was all about distracting the eye from the beat-up beige walls; we used paintings, colorful decorations that hang from the wall and ceiling, and the items we are selling tend to come in bold, bright colors so that helps, too. We put stuffed animals out as decorations and created a clothesline on our most prominent wall to display seasonal items; right now we have Halloween costumes on that wall.\nChristine: You sell kids' clothing, toys, baby gear, and maternity clothes. What have been some of your favorite, most amazing finds to walk in the door?\nAmy: It's funny, the best \"finds\" are very personal. I love stuffed animals that are characters from books and get excited when a new one comes in, like Madeline or Snoopy.\nSusan: I love when great gear shows up, like an almost new jogging stroller or a highly sought after Bumbo seat. I also get very excited about great books and particularly cute girls clothes (as I have two boys, I enjoy the chance to see all of the great girls things)! We recently got a Thomas Train table and I am waiting to see how long that will last.\nChristine: Your nominator wrote, “Since opening this summer, Amy and Susan have opened a beautiful retail space, organized a small army of volunteers, and raised over $7,000!” Are you aware of what that money actually funds (e.g., staff, longer library hours, utilities, etc.)? Meaning, roughly, what does it take to keep a small but thriving branch library open for business?\nSusan & Amy: The library costs approximately $90,000 per year to operate, although closing it wouldn't save the town nearly that much, as most of the salary costs of the senior staff positions would simply be transferred to the cost of operating the main library. Our goal is to raise enough money to keep the town from considering The Fox a liability.\nChristine: Clearly, your efforts are paying off and the shop is growing. Where are your greatest areas of need for volunteers? How can people get involved to help? What kind of commitment is involved?\nSusan & Amy: We are constantly amazed at the quality and dedication of our volunteers, but we can always use more. Since many of the volunteers who run the shop are also moms, their availability can change at a moment's notice; when something in their household changes, whether it is a shift in childcare arrangements or a new job for themselves or their partner. We also have a few retired people working at the shop and they are a great help since they are able to work hours that are difficult for those with young families to volunteer (like pickup time at the elementary schools). Working at the Little Fox is fun! If you worked retail as a young person, running the register can bring back memories. For retired people, the Little Fox can be a low-key workplace and a place to socialize. Our volunteers work as little as once a month for a couple of hours or 2-3 hours each week; it's completely up to them. See the volunteer page of our website for more information on volunteering at the shop.\nChristine: You’re both mothers of two children. How do you juggle your efforts with The Little Fox Shop with parenting? Do your children come to work with you?\nSusan & Amy: Susan often brings her children to the store while she works. Sometimes she lets them borrow books or small toys from the shop as an incentive, but most of the time they are happy to be there since it's a toy store where they can play with all of the toys! Amy is able to work in the store with her older daughter who is 4 1/2, but not very well with her younger girl, who is 18 months old (she likes to wander out the door)! Amy's husband works at home, so she often runs over to the store during her younger daughter's nap or works the evening shift on Wednesday while her husband makes dinner and puts the kids to bed. The summer was a challenging time to start the store since our kids were home with us full-time, but now that we have volunteers running the store much of the time, things have gotten much easier for us and our families. And it helps that we both live within walking distance of the store.\nChristine: I truly find your efforts so commendable and I wonder whether one or both of you have strong roots in community service. Is this work part of a long history of helping others?\nSusan & Amy: We definitely love to help others. Susan's background is in Macro Social Work, which means working with groups and populations on issues that they face; one facet of that is community organizing of which there is a strong element at the Little Fox. For the past 2 years, Amy has been running the Arlington Parents List, an email list with over 1500 local parents. Before that, she taught a basic computer skills class for low-income mothers. We also have a strong interest in recycling, and the fact that we are helping families to reuse and recycle is important to us.\nChristine: We’ve talked exclusively about The Little Fox Shop until now. We’d love to know more about you both; give us a snapshot of your history and interests.\nSusan: A snapshot of my history? That is tough. OK, very quick. I grew up the daughter of two ministers learning about helping to give to our community and protecting our world. In college I majored in psychology and then afterwards worked in children's theater with a focus on social issues. As I said before, my graduate degree is in Macro Social Work (from BU). My interests are making everything around me better....maybe that is too ambitious?! In reality I love to read, camp, bike, and go on adventure with my family. I love to be challenged and am relishing my experiences in starting a non-profit!\nAmy: I grew up in Texas and California, but came to Boston as a freshman at BU. I majored in English Literature but added a Computer Science minor at the last minute so I'd be able to find a job when I graduated! My husband and I love to travel and have tried to continue to explore the world, even though we now take up more than one row on an airplane. I enjoy making paper collage and reading crafty blogs. I also have been known to stay up half the night reading a book. Text the word \"novel\" to the number 41411 to get a list of my favorite books. Try it, it really works!\nSusan: As a Boston mama I love the fact that there is so much to do. I can take my children to festivals, fairs, concerts, and museums or just bike on the Esplanade, sail on lakes and rivers, or explore the parks. If you can't find something to do or somewhere to go, you simply aren't trying hard enough!\nAmy: Playgrounds and sandwiches. I'm not kidding, Boston has the best sandwiches. We love to get a great sandwich and eat it while the kids play at the playground. Most of our favorite places for sandwiches are in Cambridge, but we have been known to get a pizza and walk to Spy Pond right here in Arlington and watch the sun go down as the girls play with stones on the edge of the water."

        "text": "ATPases belong to the class of acid anhydride hydrolases. The most common ATPases (24 proteins) contain the classical mononucleotide-binding motif, which is known as the P-loop or Walkermotif. A second subfamily exists as the GHL ATPase family, including Hsp90, PMS2, MutL and DNA gyrase B, and share the same left-handed β-α-β-fold. Four conserved sequence motifs have been identified in these enzymes. Finally, β-actin, Hsp70 and FtsA contain a more complex nucleotide-binding site and form the third and last subfamily of ATPases. The presence of various types of nucleotide-binding site in ATPases is of interest for drug discovery, as it might allow the design of compounds that specifically target only one type.\nThe class of Heat-shock proteins (Hsps; EC 3.6.-.-), the molecular chaperones, comprises five major and broadly conserved families: Hsp100s, Hsp90s, Hsp70s, Hsp60s, and small heat shock proteins (sHsps). The stress proteins are typically named after their molecular size in kilodaltons. They are required for the correct folding and maintenance of client proteins in biologically active conformations, and to stabilize them against heat stress and toxic chemicals (particularly heavy metals). Although Hsps are ubiquitously expressed proteins, increased expression of Hsps in a stressed cell is mediated primarily by so-called heat shock transcription factors (HSFs, 1-4). Hsps bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and ATP hydrolysis is required for its function, and is the key driving force for conformational conversions within the chaperone. Although inactive heat shock proteins exhibit weak to nonexistent ATPase activity, the presence of a substrate peptide in the binding domain stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsps, increasing its normally slow rate of ATP hydrolysis,. In addition, a variety of co-chaperones, immunophilins, and other proteins are involved in the Hsp90-mediated protein folding pathway.\n ATPases as drug targets: learning from their structure. P.

The price of the kit includes 1 Litre of our Palladium Tank Plating Solution which contains 6 grams of palladium per litre and can be shipped outside the UK and EU, making it a good substitute for our transport restricted rhodium and platinum plating processes.\nOur Palladium Tank Plating Solution deposits a bright white, hard-wearing layer of palladium and is an excellent alternative to rhodium for re-plating white gold wedding and engagement rings. Another notable feature of our palladium plating system is that you can safely palladium plate items of jewellery that include materials such as pearl or coral without having to mask them out, as our Palladium Tank Plating Solution will not etch materials made from calcium carbonate. This was the case with the pearl and silver pendant in the picture; the whole of the pendant, pearls included, was immersed in our Palladium Plating Solution without any negative effect on the pearls. For a guide to setting up your Palladium Tank Plating Kit you can follow the same instructions for our Rhodium Tank Plating Kit which can be found in our Electroplating Manual by clicking HERE.\nThis kit (or any of our other kits, equipment or solutions) is not suitable for plating on to aluminium or titanium and therefore can’t be used to plate iPhones and other similar products. If you are planning on palladium tank plating on to copper and its alloys including brass and bronze you’ll need to brush plate a barrier layer of gold flash to protect your tank plating solution.\nIn between uses of your palladium tank plating solution, it’s a good idea to cover your solution with cling film to stop particles of duct and hair getting in as this will over time shorten the life of your solution. It will also reduce the frequency of having to filter your solution.\nStepped voltage controlled via a selector switch enabling a range from 3 up to 12 volts. Maximum current is 3.0 amps. Perfect for powering the cleaning stage, removing the need to re-set the settings on your MF Rectifier from cleaning to plating.\nPalladium plating solution is agitated with a magnetic stirrer at the bottom of the beaker during plating. Mechanical agitation is a safer alternative to air agitation, as it eradicates any risk of the aerosol effect of the rhodium tank plating solution. Mechanical agitation keeps the plating solution moving over the surface of the item being plated in a consistent way, again maximising the efficiency of the tank plating process. Mechanical agitation avoids unnecessary oxidisation of the metal plating solution that air agitation will cause.\nMade bespoke from solid stainless steel and designed to be used in conjunction with the Plating Arm Clamp Fully conductive. Will not corrode and contaminate palladium tank plating solution. When used with clamp, can be moved up or down the stand in any position to fit any size of plating beaker.\nThe advertised kit is using the 250ml kit. If you want to upsize to the 1 litre kit, you will need to remove the 250ml Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 250ml Beaker, Stirring Bar (Mini) and 250ml of Palladium Tank Plating Solution from the kit list.\nYou will then need to add the 1 Litre Plating Beaker, Mesh Electrode for 1 Beaker, Stirring Bar (Medium) and 1 litre of Palladium Tank Plating Solution."

Featuring the voices of Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Ripa, Nicollette Sheridan, Tim Curry, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Patrick, and others, the film’s over-reliance on what they felt was a fascinating and relatable children’s plot involving the young insects bogs down the film which would have benefited greatly by focusing exclusively on the astronauts.\nThis is especially apparent as it seems both completely awkward and like some strange “surprise party” styled prank on the audience in the film’s conclusion when heroic Buzz Aldrin himself walks out during the end titles to discredit every single thing that had transpired in the fictitious animated adventure, most likely to distance NASA from what can truly be called a cinematic waste of “space.” So, in other words, grab a swatter and some bug spray as that'll teach kids to imagine that houseflies have \"the right stuff.\""

In my exploration of this topic, I found the blog of a young British social worker who wrote a blog called “Fighting Monsters.” She has since closed the blog, for personal reasons she did not disclose. But I was very struck by the quote she references while explaining the name of her blog.\n“Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.” Nietzsche.\nFor her that was about the monster “mental disorder and illness.” For me it applies to all of the various ways we want to help and give care. If we don’t pay attention, we will fall into the very trap we are trying to help our clients climb out of. Stress, anxiety and depression are the most common warnings of the beginning fall. As professionals who work to support clients facing any number of difficult challenges, we need to be sure we have the appropriate tools to manage stress. But knowing stress is a problem and doing something about it are frequently two different things. It’s a bit of the forest from the trees problem. When we are standing in the middle of the stress we really think we are handling it quite well. If we can step back a few steps, we frequently find that we are doing a pretty poor job of it.\nThe most amazing part of this discussion, is that everything we use when we talk with clients are things that are available to us as professionals – and vice versa. Everything we talk about in these articles on stress are important for clients and therapists alike. There are four important elements in any stress management approach – TALK, WRITE, THINK, MOVE. The next four posts will take them on."

If you only focus on search engine optimization and nothing else, your web site may be friendlier to the web robots at Google than it is to your web site visitors, which can hurt your conversion rate. If you only focus on social media and nothing else, you may not get the return on investment you are looking for.\nWeb design, SEO, and social media are 3 important components of a successful Internet marketing strategy. If you want visitors to find you, you need outstanding SEO. If you want them to contact you or purchase from your site, you need great web design. If you want to create a lot of word-of-mouth recognition or implement a viral marketing campaign, social media can be an excellent tool for you.\nAs a business owner, you should know that there is no one-size-fit-all online marketing strategy. There may be a lot of buzz on social media, but it may or may not be right for your business. This is why we always start by reviewing your business goals. When clients ask us: “How much should I spend on SEO? Should I create a Facebook page for my business? Do I need to redesign my web site? Is pay per click right for me? Should I start a blog?” Our answer is it only makes sense if it relates to your business goals.\nWhat are your business goals? What is currently working and not working for you?\nHow are you attracting new customers? How much are you spending on each of these avenues? What percentage of your new customers comes from each of these avenues?\nHow are you retaining your existing customers? What methods are you employing to encourage repeat purchases?\nWhat is the primary goal of your web site? To attract new customers? To service existing customers? To test a new market segment?\nWhat are you currently doing with your online marketing? How does this fit within your marketing strategy? How does your marketing strategy fit with your overall business goal? And how does your business goal fit with your lifestyle goal?\nOnly by taking a look at the big picture can we help you answer questions such as how much you should spend on SEO or whether you should do social media. A marketing strategy that works wonders for someone else may or may not be right for your business or your lifestyle. This is the reason we have 2 departments: the technical people who are experts at SEO, social media, and web design, and the business consultants who can help you review and design the marketing strategy that is right for you. Many of our business consultants are business owners themselves and have tested various marketing strategies in their own businesses, so they speak from experience rather than a memorized sales pitch.\nMore importantly than knowing the relative importance of web design, SEO, and social media is having a coherent marketing strategy that fits your business objectives and lifestyle goals. Only then can you confidently achieve the return on investment you are looking for."

        "text": "I have been living and working in Médecins Sans Frontières’ hospital since the clashes began in March. I’ve only been able to leave the hospital twice since then. The first time was to refer a patient to a specialised hospital as his life was in danger. Thankfully, he is now alive and well.\nThe second time was to participate in the burial of a dear friend who had died. He was an administrative employee in a local hospital but was working as a volunteer to provide first aid to the injured. One day, he was transferring an injured patient to the hospital.\nThe car was going fast—there was no ambulance and they were using an open pickup. My friend fell from the car and was taken to a hospital. I was not able to visit him, as I was busy here; we were receiving many cases and it was important for me to stay in order to supervise the nurses, nursing assistants, cleaning staff, and others. On the third day after his injury, I received news of his death. The second time I went outside the hospital was to say farewell to my friend and participate in the burial. He was a pleasant, hard-working and brave person.\nMy family left with our neighbours to an area outside Aden for their own safety. I wasn’t able to see them or say goodbye. My house is not far from the hospital, about 3km away, but it feels like thousands of kilometres. I cannot go and check if everything is OK there. I heard from some neighbours that our neighbourhood has been affected by shells, but I don’t know the condition of my house. Is it locked? Have the windows been broken? Has it been robbed?\nAll I do is work and eat and take some rest if I can. Often, I try to sleep but am woken by an emergency and have to make sure everything is going as planned in order to receive the injured. We are still receiving significant numbers of patients despite the fact that many have difficulties reaching the hospital. Some patients told me they had to pay 10 times [more] for transport compared with prices before the clashes, so they are the ones who make it to the hospital. So, for a trip that used to cost 500 Yemeni rials (about $2.50), some people are now paying 5,000-6,000 rials to come to the hospital.\nThis amount is difficult to afford in the current circumstances, especially as so many people have not received their salaries due to the bank and post offices and foreign exchange centres being closed, and the extreme difficulty of movement in the city.\nFood and water are additional problems, besides fuel shortages and the deteriorating security situation in Aden. Some of my neighbours say that they are taking two meals and sometimes only one meal a day after having to wait in long queues to buy food.\nIt is the same problem with water, with people having to queue with jerry cans. We are facing all this in the hot summer of Aden, which gets hotter every day. Though we usually have food for the people in the hospital, sometimes we face problems providing it as we cannot go out. Restaurants and grocery stores are closed in areas where there are clashes.\nOur biggest fear is that the fighting will surround the hospital. Many times, when the clashes intensify, we go down to the basement. But this creates a different problem. Before we save ourselves, we move the patients who are in beds near windows to a safe place. This has happened many times. We hear the sound of gunshots and shelling or air strikes and we move all the patients to safe areas before finding a safe place for ourselves. Windows at the hospital have been broken more than once and bullets have entered, but no one has been hurt inside the hospital.\nSome of our medical team in Aden have lost family members due to the fighting. Some have lost a father, a brother, a friend. Sometimes members of the team leave the hospital to check on their families and we hear nothing about them for a week or two due to the bad telecommunications coverage or the unstable security situation, which forces them to stay home.\nI have no idea how long things will stay like this. I am very sad to see what has happened to Aden. A friend of mine tells me that I will not believe my eyes if I go to the Crater district of Aden now. Crater is my favourite place in Aden and I have many beautiful memories of being there.\nWe have to forget about our pain and motivate ourselves to continue working and providing healthcare to patients. As for the ceasefire we heard so much about, we have not felt it here in Aden."

        "text": "FREDERICTON– Nearly 7,000 immigrants entered the province’s workforce between 2011 and 2016, contributing about $168 million annually to the provincial budget, according to an economic impact study conducted by Jupia Consultants for the New Brunswick Multicultural Council (NBMC).\nAlex LeBlanc, executive director of NBMC, says it’s difficult to show the exact impact of immigrants on the economy, so the report includes economic models and estimations based on various data sets from Statistics Canada.\n“What [the report] shows is that if they arrived between 2011 and 2016 and they were participating in the workforce to that extent, there really is a pretty quick integration into the workforce. And within that five-year period, people hit the ground running,” he said.\nAccording to the report, the contribution is based on more than $129 million of implied annual tax payments to the province, and federal transfer payments, which amounted to $4,200 per capita in 2017. The transfer payments “are almost entirely distributed based on population,” the report said.\nLeBlanc said with more than 64 per cent of the provincial budget relying on residents’ taxes, it’s necessary to grow the population.\n“If we’re going to have a plan for growing our economy and maintaining our public services, it has to be anchored in growing our population base,” he said.\nThe report also found that the 6,960 immigrants plus more than 900 international students have a direct impact of $516 million to the province’s GDP. This doesn’t include contributions from immigrant-owned businesses.\n“It also doesn’t include the significant resources that immigrants often bring with them to support their early stage settlement. And it doesn’t include other forms of investment [from governments],” LeBlanc said.\nOverall, including indirect and induced effect, recent immigrants and international post-secondary students support 11,680 jobs.\nLast year, 4,610 permanent residents came to New Brunswick, according to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). While the number was slightly higher in 2016 due to the influx of Syrian refugees, LeBlanc says 2018’s number shows a different significance.\n“This is an unprecedented level of economic immigration to New Brunswick, meaning that people are coming here with an attachment to the workforce,” he said.\nIn Canada, economic immigrants are people who are selected for their skills, including language proficiency, and ability to contribute to the country’s economy. They include skilled workers, business immigrants, provincial nominees and live-in caregivers, among others.\nFredericton continues to be the top destination for newcomers to New Brunswick, receiving 1,470 immigrants last year. Moncton, which has boosted efforts to increase immigration in recent years, follows closely behind with 1,440. Saint John received 835 immigrants. Bathurst, Miramichi, Edmundston and Campbellton saw fewer than 100 newcomers each last year.\nNewcomers are also doing better in the labour market, the report said.\nIn December 2018, there were 7,900 more immigrants in New Brunswick’s labour force compared to December 2013 – a 54 per cent increase. Around 7,700 of them were working, marking a 57 per cent increase since 2013 and the highest in the last 100 years in New Brunswick. More than 80 per cent of those working held full-time jobs.\nThe labour market participation rate of recent immigrants also increased from 57.1 per cent in 2013 to 80 per cent in 2018.\nAt the same time, the number of people born in Canada that are active in the labour force dropped by 18,400.\nThe higher number of newcomers that came to New Brunswick wasn’t enough to offset this loss, “it only blunted the blow,” LeBlanc said.\n“The only segment of the workforce that’s growing is the immigrant segment. So people need to understand that one of the fundamental reasons why we’re trying to attract people to our province is because we need the workers,” said Jupia Consultants president David Campbell.\nThe provincial government’s labour market forecast now predicts there will be approximately 120,000 job vacancies in the next 10 years. Because of this, the NBMC says 1 per cent of population growth annually needs to come from immigration. That’s around 7,500 newcomers a year.\n“That figure, 1 per cent of growth, would be more or less what the national average is, so we’re really not striving for anything that’s unachievable or unreasonable here,” LeBlanc said.\nWith immigration up 26 per cent from 2017 to 2018, NBMC wants to see more investments in settlement agencies and community services through municipalities, and others. The province currently invests $8.3 million in its Population Growth Division, which leads newcomer attraction, integration and retention efforts.\n“We can’t increase the intake and expect a better result without investing. If we want to retain more people, it’s not going to happen on its own. We have to make sure that the supports are in place so that the employers have the support they need, and spouses and children integrate well,” LeBlanc said.\nThe NBMC is also pushing for a clearer and faster way to recognize foreign professional credentials for newcomers. It also wants to see a “very clear and intentional” plan on immigration for rural and francophone communities, and an “ambitious strategy” to retain international students.\n“They represent a major opportunity for the province both in terms of driving and fueling our post-secondary institutions but also in terms of growing our workforce,” he said."

Lecturers and Judges who do not receive adequate information may decline the booking. Simply sending an email is not enough – you must ensure that you have also received a reply in order to ensure that your booking is made securely.\nFrom time to time clubs like to create a flyer or a blog post about a forthcoming lecture, illustrated by an image by the guest speaker. Please ensure that you ask permission of the speaker and don’t just take an image from his/her website. Most speakers will supply an image or two if asked!\nReminders should be sent at least 10 days before the event.

In the L&CPU, our approved lecturers and judges do not charge a fee in addition to their travel expenses.\nSome other organisations make lectures and workshops available for Clubs, where the cost may be partly or wholly covered by sponsorship. Details are in some Federation and the PAGB Handbooks.\nClubs may engage judges and lecturers not listed by a Federation or the PAGB on any mutually accepted terms. These should be agreed at the time of booking.\nThe L&CPU judges list is now divided up into sections.\nPAGB judges are those who have been invited to be listed on the PAGB’s own Judges List. They are judges who have experience of judging at higher level than club internal competitions. This would include judging at federation and/or Open Exhibition level. It is desirable that they are exhibitors themselves and are conversant with current standards and quality at open Exhibition level.\nAccredited Judges are those who have taken part in the accreditation scheme and have received positive feedback from clubs – they have also attended a seminar or judge training session since the scheme was introduced.\nStandard Judges are those who have not been through the accreditation scheme. Many of these judges are very experienced. The accreditation scheme is voluntary for all but new judges.\nNew judges are added to the list from time to time and they appear in a separate listing so that clubs are aware that they have recently joined the list.

        "text": "Very Long Post Ahead. Here it is - that time again. This End of the Year Survey hosted by The Perpetual Page-Turner has remained a favorite of mine to look forward to every year. It's enjoyable to reflect back on the past twelves month and what I've read, picking out my favorites, the quirks, the hit or miss moments. If you're curious on my answers from previous months, check out 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n2016 has been another excellent year with reading.\nI passed my Goodreads goal (the highest set yet), and although I doubt I can do it every year depending on what's going on, for the first time I went over 200 books. I remember when I barely made 100, then 150, now this. I focused on trying to get a number of books done per month (17) and making up for months when I was short of the goal other times. As always it was a fun year of reading - I discovered new favorite authors, finished some series I wanted to get through, discovered some new 2016 reads, and had general fun participating in some team challenges on GR.\nYearly Challenges Participated In: On the blog, 13. On Goodreads, four team challenges and multiple individual challenges.\nI can never, ever name just one. I read several five stars this year - I'm not including re-reads for this one.\nBook you were excited about and thought you'd love more but didn't?\nWith this book's classic reputation and plot synopsis, I thought it would be a sure thing to enjoy this book. Sadly I ended up irritated part of the time, bored the other, and only intrigued a few snatched chapters in between. The writing style is fine, but the characters were a turn-off, the pacing too slow, and I didn't like the message or themes of the story.\nLegacy of the Demon by Diana Rowland - after enjoying the last sequel so much, I was excited about the new release in 2016. It was a three star rating, but not as much oomph as some of the others in the series. Strangewood by Christopher Golden looked fascinating but it wasn't a fun intro to the author. I was walking along Robert McCammon's horror trail and enjoying myself, but The Night Boat sunk my expectations. The Nightingale didn't live up to the hype and reputation either. Another disappointment was how much I loved the other books in the December People series, but the 2016 release of A Taste of Death and Honey didn't satisfy me nearly as much as the ones that came before it.\nMost surprising (in a good or bad way) book you read in 2016?\nIn a good way, The Lord of the Flies ended up being an excellent classic that impressed me with its heavy themes, well-done writing and thought-provoking ending. It has mixed reviews, but I have to say I'm a fan and the book hasn't left me since I've read it.\nA re-read was 'The Exorcist', which I tried to re-read last year after over 15 years since my last read. I found the writing style dry and didn't pick up again until this year. Once I got past the distant first quarter, the book became excellent and hard to put down.\nA book you \"pushed\" the most people to read in 2016?\nI convinced a few people to give the book Dead Sea a chance, and sort of funny, but a book I read two years ago (Evil by Richard O'Brien) was picked up by my review and comments for two new people this year, who bought and reviewed the book afterward.\nI also pushed two people toward the Kelley Armstrong Bitten series as I was discovering and gushing over it myself this year.\nHARRY POTTER - Yes, I finally read this series and became a huge fan. Even bought its box set and a Harry figurine.\nWOMEN OF THE OTHERWORLD - Purchased and read all of these this year, excellent series with an unique premise.\nTHE INNKEEPER by Ilona Andrews - Read these three this year (fun series with Andrews' usual talented style, humor, and well-crafted scenes.\nBURN FOR ME by Ilona Andrews - Let's just say the book was so good it blew me away as a top favorite in that genre, and it may rival my love of the Kate Daniels series if it keeps going as strongly.\nBest series ender in 2016?\nThat would be the final book in the Society of Gentlemen by K.J. Charles as mentioned above.\nAlso I have to give major kudos to Spook Squad, which ended the long-running PsyCop series by Jordan Castillo Price. It wasn't released in 2016, though, so it may not count for this category other than personal experience and new-to-me stuff.\nFavorite new author in 2016?\nEdward Lorn impressed me with his writing style in Bay's End, and I'm excited to read more of Greg Gifune's work in the near future. Both are dark drama, thriller and horror authors I'm itchy to read more of. T.J. Klune's writing style blew me away in the M/M romance Wolfsong, although I won't gravitate toward all her works because some of the themes aren't up my alley the way her other paranormal stuff is. Newcomer Katherine Arden gives me high hopes for her future novels, of which I'll definitely read, especially if they involve surreal concepts and fairy tales again. Sam Argent delighted me with her writing style as well in Family of Lies: Sebastian.\nBest book from a genre typically out of your comfort zone?\nI rarely read non-fiction about a biography of animals or cats (despite being a huge animal lover), but it was a delightful new experience to read Dewey's story.\nMost..action-packed/thrilling/unputdownable book of the year?\nUltimately I'm going to give the gold star to Children of Chaos by Greg Gifune, a hard to book down novel that kept the tension high, the scenes dark, and the outcome brutally powerful, and a second gold star to Bait by J. Kent Messum - excellent books with sharks battling addicts on an island controlled by madmen. Excellent and a rush.\nI already had to re-read A Boy and His Dragon, which delighted me with it's slow build-up and sweet love story. The big winner for a re-read that WILL happen soon in anticipation for the next of the series release is Burn for Me by Ilona Andrews. Love that book and have a feeling I'll be re-reading a few times.\nFavorite Book Cover of a book you read in 2016?\nMost Memorial Character of 2016?\nHarry Potter and the crew stood out with their series for good reason.\nPeter Pan, the boy who will never grow up, impressed me with his hope and tragedy.\nFor new releases, definitely The Bear and the Nightingale.\nFor releases before 2016 but new to me, I'm going to throw kudos out to Bay's End by Edward Lorn for haunting nostalgic feel with poetic impressions, Algernon Blackwood's The Willows, Khaled Hosseni's The Kite Runner, TJ Klune's Wolf Song, and Naomi Novik's Uprooted.\nMost thought provoking book read in 2016?\nThe Kite Runner opened my eyes to different aspects of life I'm not used to - I think it's the first time I've read a book from the point of view of an Afghanistan. The Pearl irritated me because it reiterated that you should try for what makes you happy; you only live once.\nBook you can't believe you waited till 2016 to finally read?\nLongest is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at 870 pages. Shortest is Blackwater Lake by Maggie James at 98 Pages.\nActually, not really any this year. No shock endings or twist surprises. I was saddened and dismayed by a death at the end of The Cabinet of Curiosities that I didn't see coming. Through the Grinder had a heartbreaking and surprise ending.\nThere can never be JUST one.\nI loved the bond between Clay and Jeremy, as well as Elena and Jeremy. One close-knit created family.\nBait by J. Kent Messum - not peer pressure, but seemed like most of my friends were suddenly reading and review it at the same time.\nI don't realize half the time that a book is an author's debut. Ones I do know are Family of Lies: Sebastian and The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden. Both well written.\nI like how involved and varied the supernatural world is in the Women of the Otherworld series.\nI like the use of ghosts, necromancy and ghouls in the Night Huntress series.\nOf course, the creepy world building for the Dead Sea was imaginative and chilling.\n/the most fun to read?\nThe ending of The Cabinet of Curiosities depressed me with a character death. I cried during a death scene in Wolf Song. I got a teary-eyed in The Kite Runner. A little bit of tears at the end of my re-read of Seeds of Yesterday. I found the end of Through the Grinder the most depressing. Saddest was probably the end of Bay's End, although the author warned of what was coming.\nFalling Angel is an oldie but unique book in the hardboiled detective genre.\nI was annoyed at some deaths at the end of Children of Chaos.\nI joined a few team challenges on Goodreads that I had a lot of fun with - W.O.B.B.L.E.S. was the winner for the most enjoyable, long-running team challenge.\nI didn't have a huge moment offline like I did in 2014 (meeting a favorite author) and 2015 (visiting Goodreads office on free San Francisco trip), but I did enjoy myself reading. I was accepted as a moderator for the first time on a few Goodreads groups - A Million More Pages and Got Books?\nPost you wish got more love?\nBest bookish discovery (sites, stores, etc)?\nOne book you didn't get to in 2016 but will be a priority in 2017?\nBook you are most anticipating in 2017 that is a non-debut?\nDefinitely the next of the Burn for me series - supposed to be two of them!\nI don't keep track of debuts, I just run into them.\nOne thing you hope to accomplish/do in blogging or reading life in 2017?\nI want to start setting a special night aside to review books every week and not get so behind."

Any girl would be excited for Christmas because that’s when boyfriends prove their worth! But there are always worries that go along with a season that makes you think of love – does he like me, is he being faithful, do we spend enough time together? Honestly, the only solution to all of these problems is to lock him up and tie him to a chair to make sure you two will be together… FOREVER!\nMoving on from all of the tsundere, we are happy to introduce another original character, Yuukin Aikyou. She is just like any other girl – caring, loving, sweet and will make sure that she does whatever is necessary to keep you two together. Hear that? Whatever is necessary. Yanderes are most commonly characterized by their crazy side, be it in love or otherwise. Check out this 4koma for a first hand example.\nWatch out, because Yuu is possessive of everything. But our yandere, Yuukin, did not gain this personality by chance. Her father was often away on business trips which left her mother always alone. To make matters worse, her mother did not understand Japanese and ended up ostracized from her community due to her foreign appearance. Over the years she developed a tendency to go into hysterical fits of depression and anxiety because of her isolation. All the meanwhile, their daughter grew up with misaligned values and a warped idea of what love is. It seems like Yuu gained these “yanderu” tendencies by absorbing the negative emotions of her household, which eventually fell apart right before she got into middle school. It’s certainly ironic that their family name is Aikyou (愛嬌), which means attractive and pleasant.\nPrevious story Do you REALLY know what a Magic Circle is?"

Thanks to Amy for writing today’s post on the newest fashion destination in Nashville: Anthropologie Shoes and Accessories.\nWhat is it about spending a little time in Anthropologie that seems to soothe the soul? Mine, anyway. Whenever I need a pick-me-up (i.e. Winter 2011 – all of it), a quick spin through this favorite haunt always seems to lift my spirits. Doesn’t matter if I leave with the smallest of trinkets –maybe a candle or new pair of earrings– or an entire outfit purchased in anticipation of a new season. Although I might skulk in as Madame Frump, I always skip out feeling a little bit new again. And discovering a different way to reframe myself makes me happy to contemplate the contents of my closet again.\nHaving just attended the grand opening of Anthropologie’s Shoes and Accessories Boutique in the Mall at Green Hills last week, I’m thrilled to know that all of my discretionary spending will now be trackable to one place. (Who needs groceries anyway, right?) Since I was a child, I’ve had a fetish for accessories, and Anthro’s newest store is brimming with amazing adornments from all around the world (not to mention our own back yard) in the form of jewelry, handbags, scarves, belts and shoes. Anything you need to elevate your standard issue jeans-and tee from “wah” to “wow” can be found here. Just take a seat on the emerald green velvet divan in the shoe gallery and soak up the visual feast of all the baubles around you and you’ll see what I mean.\nVintage sunglasses. Never worn, discovered in a warehouse by an enterprising buyer.\nHow about a little old fashioned needlepoint as a case for your iPhone? Love it. Whimsy and design courtesy of Virginia Johnson.\nWhether it’s vintage jewelry or custom handbags designed exclusively for the company, Katherine’s buyers literally travel the globe in search of the treasures they know their customers want. Says Katherine, “From Nepal to Ecuador, we find artisans in the craziest places creating amazing things…and the cohesive nature of our collection comes from knowing our clientele and buying for their particular aesthetic.” Note: 20% of the merchandise in the Nashville store is unique to this city, and 50% is unique to Anthropologie. So if you’ve ever wondered how a chain retailer can have stores dotted across the globe and feel different in each locale, now you know why.\nA Case Study in Vintage Jewelry You’ll Only Find in Nashville. Reminds me of things I have from my grandmother’s jewelry box, only better. No pinchy clip-on earrings.\nAnthropologie Accessories offers jewelry lines from six local designers, one of whom is Kari Beth, pictured here by a display of her vintage jewelry. And if she looks familiar, that may be because you’ve shopped with her at the Anthro store in the Hill Center. Worlds collide!\nCompany-wide, from the designers, to the buyers to the sales associates, Anthropologie focuses on making the impossible find possible and offers endless and as-yet unimagined possibilities for creative self-expression. Sounds more like an art gallery than a retail chain, right? Precisely.\nInsider Shopping Tip: We’re told to always ask if there’s stock in the back not out on display. Anthropologie constantly receives new merchandise. All you have to do is ask what’s new.\nDon’t miss the StyleBlueprint huge $1,500 giveaway this week featuring Jamie, AshBlue, Judith Bright and H.

However, factors including climate in certain regions force the development of new designs for military bases that are better suited to local conditions. This is arguably the case for the Panama Houses of the former Charleston Navy Yard, which are an example of a vernacular building type imported from a foreign context. While scholars have looked from a broad perspective at the Navy Yard and the more prominent structures, no study has been completed considering the history and form of the Panama House. Bringing together architectural evidence from this group of buildings and U.S. housing in the former Panama Canal Zone, this study explores the origins of the Panama House and the factors that brought it to Charleston, ultimately positioning this vernacular form within the context of the region and United States military installations."

        "text": "Learning at the Speed of Business (Part 3): All Hail the Queen!\nIn part one of this blog series I wrote about the many and varied theories of learning. And in part two, I described the many different trends which are influencing the rapid change we see in the way people learn. Even with all this complexity, at the end of my previous blog I promised some good news – there is one thing which remains constant: context!\nFor me this was a particularly thought provoking question – what are you learning when you sit in a classroom? I’m sure that most of you have attended some kind of classroom training, and however good it might have been you probably went straight back to your workplace having forgotten most of what you learnt.\nWhen I am presenting at Learning events, I often ask the audience a simple question. Take a moment to reflect, and to think about your most memorable learning experience. Where did it take place? In a classroom? Or while performing some task? When I ask this of my audiences, usually 90% of people say it is while performing some task. After recovering from the disappointment stemming from the fact that no one had replied that my presentation was their most memorable learning experience, I realised that this simple test brings me to our simple constant of learning. Learning is always more effective when delivered in context. Most learning professionals will tell you that content is king (and they’re right!). I will add to this – if content is king, context is queen. What is content without context? Irrelevant.\nDon’t just take my word for it (although you should because I am right!). There is some interesting research which brought us the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, which among other things tells us that we forget about 50% of what we learn within one day if we do not have a chance to put it into practice.\nThis is actually not a new concept for learning professionals. In traditional training environments, a good deal of effort goes into creating an artificial context where some sort of simulation or exercise is constructed, and it is within this context that the learning objectives are achieved. In some cases a huge amount of effort and expense is put into making the learning environment as “real” as possible.\nWhen we consider the context for learning, we have three main considerations: timing, relevance and consistency. When deciding on a user enablement strategy you need to address all three challenges by looking at learning as a process which includes the classroom, but doesn’t begin and end there.\nFor instance, where transactions are infrequently used, e-Reference solutions become invaluable (more on this shortly). Appropriately developed and located reference material can help introduce or revise a transaction the user has not encountered for some time. Similarly, not all transactions are best explained in an instructor-led session. Assessing the value risk of each transaction – the combination of the frequency, complexity and business value – helps determine what method of enablement is most useful.\nYou might have interpreted from my comments so far that I’m not a fan of classroom training. Actually my own belief is that classroom training is very important, and can play an essential role in building the foundation on which further context-specific knowledge can be built. Classroom training may include role-based training design, simulations, games, and so on. Acquiring new information in a generic classroom environment removes all cues to memory that would help later.\nBut by creating artificial cues – designing the physical environment so that it resembles the workplace, for example, you can establish cues for memory retrieval which will help preserve the learning later. Role-based training using accurate, relevant examples won’t just make the learning easier to acquire, but will also make the stored information easier to retrieve when required.\nThis is basically an extension and simplification of an ancient learning method – the art of story-telling. For thousands of years, most races of people have passed knowledge from one generation to the next via story-telling. This is based on the same idea, building a context to aid the acquisition and recall of knowledge. When I was managing a team of trainers with SAP Education in the UK, we used to screen test a lot of potential new trainers and I gave them all the same advice. Tell us a story… The trainers who went on to be most successful were those who were the best story-tellers.\nWhile classroom training can be very effective, it can also be very expensive, particularly if you have only a few people to be trained. For instance, what if there is a new starter in your finance team – are you going to run a full set of classroom training to bring this one person up to speed?\nIn this situation, e-learning becomes a very interesting alternative to classroom training. The same basic content can be delivered without the need of a classroom, a trainer, or any of the associated costs of classroom training. And because it is self-contained, it can be accessed at any time, and from almost any location, making it a great solution for training a single new starter.\nSo without the trainer, and without the practical exercises to reinforce the learning objectives, how do we create the all-important context? E-learning allows us to utilize multimedia to help build the context. Here we can use video, animations, simulations and so on to help construct the required context. In fact, well-constructed e-learning can be very effective. Despite this, I get the feeling that e-learning has a bad reputation, and I don’t think this is fair. I think that this is partly because many organizations purchased an e-learning solution, confusing it for e-reference.\nDon’t underestimate the positives that can accrue from learning at one’s own desk – the contextual cues may help with storage and retrieval of information. What better cue is there than a real life problem that you need to resolve? So being able to deliver learning as the answer to a problem is extremely effective.If we can deliver learning in this way, we may find that all of that artificial context that we built is now a distraction just getting in the way of resolving the issue and the learning that comes from it. In this scenario, e-learning is a poor fit. What we actually need is an e-reference solution.\nE-reference is the classic case of learning just-in-time, whereas e-learning is learning just-in-case. For complex and infrequent tasks particularly, e-reference allows information to be delivered at the time that it is required. With e-reference, learning can be delivered in context in ways pure e-learning cannot – by having a much tighter focus, it can also have greater level of detail and contextual information. And most importantly, by delivering the knowledge at exactly the point of need you are working in the “real” context – there is nothing more effective.\nI must admit that when first introduced to the concept of “gamification” I was quite cynical; I figured it was yet another one of those fads that would soon pass. But as I started to learn more about it, I became a convert and began to see that there really was some value in the idea.\nAnd with Gartner recently predicting that by 2015, 40 percent of Global 1000 organizations will use gamification as the primary mechanism to transform business operations*, [KS1] there is now a lot of interest in this field.\nI have previously written a blog on why gamification is so effective, so that should speak to my “conversion”. And I am pleased that within SAP Education APJ, we are about to launch two gaming-based solutions to support learning. We are partnering with a gaming studio called Playware Studios to develop avatar-based games to support learning in SAP environments. In addition, we are partnering with Monsoon to deliver an ERP simulation game. Both solutions show incredible potential to drive the effectiveness of learning.\nSo that’s it for part 3. I’ve spent some time here highlighting the essential role of context in learning. As we continue on our journey towards building a Learning Organisation, you will need to ensure that this essential element is well considered in approach. Perhaps the very best way to do this is via the new emerging areas of mobile and social learning, which I will be discussing in part 4 of this series."

The public is loath to think that the cesarean section being performed on a loved one results from the physician needing to make a boat payment rather than patient need. The doctors, of course, blame the lawyers claiming that lawsuits make the doctors do more cesarean sections to protect themselves from litigation. In an interesting new study available from the Social Science Research Network, MIT and University of British Columbia researchers analyzed records of births in California and Texas and have found that when the patient is a physician she is 10% less likely to receive a c-section delivery. The authors conclude that financial incentives are most likely responsible for this behavior.\nPost a Comment to \"New Study suggests doctors do more cesarean sections because of money.

        "text": "Oh boy, it’s finally here! After years of waiting and having to endure those horrible prequels, the long-awaited conclusion is finally here! Yes, that’s what I thought when I first heard the news. After years of making us wait and spend our hard earned money on a sleuth of teaser prequels and filler, Brian Herbert and KJA (or as I like to call him, NOT FRANK HERBERT!) finally delivered on their promise and released the damn Dune 7 novel!\nLike most fans, I had been waiting years for that day. Ever since KJA and Brian got together and announced that they would be releasing Dune 7, a book which Frank had apparently been working on shortly before he died, I was understandably excited. It was just a few years before this announcement that I had finally worked my way to the end of the Dune series (Chapterhouse: Dune) only to find that it ended on a cliffhanger note with numerous loose ends.\nFor example, what was this mysterious enemy that the Honored Matres were fleeing? Who were the old man and woman from Duncan’s visions? What was Duncan’s role in all this; i.e. was he the new Kwisatz Haderach or something even greater? And above all, was this all the result of Leto’s vision, or were the main characters finally free of the Tyrant’s “Golden Path”? These and other questions I wanted answered, and after many years of waiting, I kinda felt entitled!\nNeedless to say, the anticipation I felt was rivaled only by the disappointment, but that didn’t occur until the very end when the answers were revealed. There was plenty of material to disappoint in between, but I was able to endure all that so long as I got see how it all ended. I’ve said all this before, so I shan’t waste any more time with it here. Let me get to the specifics of the story and why it was such a horrible, crass, and cynical novel that left Dune fans everywhere disappointed and angry.\nAs fans of Dune are no doubt aware, this book was part I in a two part collection that was meant to tie up the series. While this novel didn’t end, it did tie up most of the threads Frank had laid down in Chapterhouse and predicted what the ultimate ending would be. It is for this reason that this book is arguably more important than its follow-up Sandwords of Dune. This book established what the conclusion would be, the other one was mere filler, seeing the threads through to their conclusion and giving every character a final farewell.\nThe story picks up three years after the events in Chapterhouse: Dune, with Duncan and the crew of the Ithaca trying to find their way in an alternate universe, hoping to stay ahead of the old man and woman. However, there efforts are upset when Duncan is spoken to telepathically by a mysterious character known as the “Oracle of Time”, a Guild agent who then plucks him from his current location and brings him back to the known universe. The old man and women realize he’s returned, and immediately begin trying to catch him in their tachyon net again.\nMeanwhile, back on Chapterhouse, Murbella is continuing with her efforts to bring the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres together in preparation for the coming war. In addition, she is approached by the Guild who are desperate for spice now that Chapterhouse is the last known source of melange. Given their past support for the Honored Matres, Murbella is loath to help them, but manages to leverage their future loyalty in exchange for not cutting them off completely. In the meantime, the Guild is in contact with the Ixians, who are busy developing a machine that will take the place of a Guild Navigator. Unbeknownst to them, Face Dancers have already infiltrated Ix and are now dealing directly with the Guild.\nThe Face Dancers are essentially doing this all over the Old Empire, infiltrating worlds and replacing key people with their own copies. Having replaced the last of the Tleilaxu masters with their own copies, their leader Khrone now focuses on infiltrating the HM’s. They do this by putting Uxtal in the custody of Hellica, the new leader of the HM’s. In exchange for sparing his life, Hellica demands that he teach them the secret of axlotl tanks. In addition, Uxtal’s tasks include creating a ghola of the Baron Harkonnen and Paul for Daniel and Marty’s purposes. The reason for this is because the old man and woman feel they will be “useful”, especially Paul who’s prescience will be intrinsic to their “calculations”.\nA third reason for his research into axlotl tanks is to create a Waff ghola so he can obtain the secret of making artificial melange (a secret thought to be lost with the destruction of the Tleilaxu Masters). This will come in handy for the Guild Navigators, who are looking for an alternative to the Sisterhood’s source. However, they are unaware that Scytale – the last surviving Tleilaxu master – has already given said secret to the crew of the Ithaca. They in turn are generating it using their own tanks for their own use, seeing as how the sandworms they have aboard are not yet mature.\nIn addition, Scytale has revealed the existence of the nullentropy tube with the ghola cells he’s kept hidden to Duncan and the Ithaca crew. He does this in exchange for the creation of a Scytale ghola, one which replace him when he dies, which is getting closer. Duncan, Sheeana and Miles all decide that it would also be in their best interests to start cloning all the other people in this tube – Paul, Leto II, Chani, Stilgar, etc. – because apparently, “they will prove useful”. Over the course of the next few years, they begin to give birth to and rear these gholas, one by one.\nIn the meantime, Murbella’s forces continue to consolidate their hold over more and more of the Old Empire, flushing out HM’s and adding their weapons and resources to their own. This includes the so-called “Devastators”, some kind of super weapon that can sterilize an entire planet. Murbella also begins searching her “Other Memory” in order to find the answers she needs; namely, where the Honored Matres came from and who their enemy is. She learns in the course of this that the HM’s are the descendents of Tleilaxu women who were freed with the help of Fish Speakers and Bene Gesserit’s from the Scattering. Hence why the HM’s seem hellbent on wiping out the Tleilaxu. There’s also the brief and needless scene where she converses with Serena Butler, figurehead of the Butlerian Jihad.\nShortly thereafter, the Sisterhood attack Ix, and Hellica, and Uxtal all die in the process. Waff however, escapes and finds refuge with the Guild, promising them the secret to breeding their own sandworms instead of artificial melange. Meanwhile, the Ithaca stumbled onto a planet that is concealed by a no-field. They find that the place was sterilized by a deadly plague, and after a very brief exploratory mission, they realize that it was this same plague that the Honored Matres were fleeing. Shortly thereafter, they come upon the planet of the Handlers, which they learn are in fact Face Dancers. In the course of trying to return the Futars to the surface, a boarding party attacks them and they are forced to flee, but some make it aboard.\nMore to follow in part two, coming up soon!"

However, it might be helpful to review these formalities.\nThe legal documents which were signed during the meeting with the funeral director enable the funeral to take place. Forms for the cemetery and also information to be lodged with the Department of Births, Deaths and Marriages were also completed during this meeting. This information not only notifies the department that your loved one has passed away but enables the department to produce the official Death Certificate. This certificate will be forwarded in four to six weeks directly to the person who signed the documentation.\nThe Bet-Olam Jewish Funeral forms (one copy for you and the other for Bet-Olam) have details of the time, car pick-up time (if applicable), date and location of the funeral.\nThis form also shows the costs which, by law, we must explain to you.\nThis is the cost of the actual grave with headstone that Springvale Botanical Gardens charges Bet-Olam Jewish funerals.\nThe cemetery internment fee is the cost of preparing or digging the actual grave – Springvale Botanical Gardens charges Bet-Olam for this service.\nThis covers the transfer, mortuary, coffin, bookings with the cemetery and death certificate lodgment. These are arrangements that Bet-Olam Jewish Funerals puts into place to enable the funeral to proceed.\nIf the service is a cremation, a fee is charged to Bet-Olam Jewish Funerals by Springvale Botanical Gardens. Also a government medical officer needs to sign a separate document which Bet-Olam staff organise.\nIf the family wishes, Bet-Olam staff will organise all press notices at cost.\nIf the deceased was a non-member of a Progressive congregation, the Religious Administration fee is charged to cover the cost of the officiating Rabbi. If the deceased was a member of Temple Beth Israel, The Leo Baeck Centre, Etz Chayim or Kedem they are exempted from the Religious Administration fee.\nIf the person who has passed away was not a member of a Progressive synagogue, this is the fee for a Rabbi to conduct the minyan.\nIf the account is paid within 14 days of receiving the Bet-Olam Jewish Funeral’s account, please deduct this amount.\nExcept under the most unusual circumstances, burials take place only in ground which has been formally set aside for Jewish use – in our case, the Jewish Memorial Gardens at the Springvale Botanical Gardens. The Jewish Memorial Gardens is most commonly used for Bet-Olam Jewish Funerals. Other sites for Jewish burial are found at the Melbourne General Cemetery, Fawkner Cemetery and the Chevra Kadisha Cemetery.\nBurials at Melbourne General and Fawkner require at least 36 hours notice, so there may be instances where the burial cannot take place as quickly as is encouraged by Jewish custom.\nIf it is known that cremation was the wish of the deceased, it is within the framework of the Progressive approach for the funeral service to be conducted under the auspices of Bet-Olam Jewish Funerals. Cremation services are often conducted at our chapel in Elsternwick.\nOur services are usually conducted as soon as practical – usually within 36 hours of a person passing away. Bet-Olam takes into account the need to delay the funeral when there are relatives arriving from overseas or interstate.\nBefore the funeral, the body is washed in a ritual act of purification called Tahara. We leave the world, just as we entered into the world, and so just as a baby is washed and enters the world clean and pure, so do we leave the world cleansed by the religious act of Tahara.\nThe ritual cleansing or Tahara is carried out by the chevra kadisha (“holy society”). The chevra kadisha is a group of specially trained Jews who care for the body and prepare it for the funeral. Strict procedures are followed, which include the recitation of psalms and prayers from the Song of Songs, Isaiah, Ezekiel and Zechariah. Men handle male bodies and women prepare female bodies; modesty is preserved even in death.\nAfter the body is cleansed, it is dressed in shrouds (in Hebrew, tachrichim). The shrouds are simple and plain and made of white cotton or linen. A tallit (prayer shawl) may be spread over the shroud if it was the deceased’s practice to wear one when praying, otherwise it may be handed down to the next generation. If a tallit is being buried, one of the fringes of the tallit is cut to show that it will no longer be used.\nThis tradition of Tahara enacted by the chevrah kaddishah is one of the oldest and most sacred of Jewish traditions, and is considered an act of true kindness or chesed shel emet, as it is not one which the deceased can ever thank them for.\nIf the coroner is involved in the death of your loved one, Bet-Olam will guide you through this process every step of the way. Our funeral directors are constantly speaking with the coroner to try to speed up the process that will allow for the dignified burial or cremation of your loved one in a respectful time frame.\nJewish tradition allows an autopsy when required by civil law, or when the knowledge gained from an autopsy might help save others suffering from the same disease. Routine autopsies where nothing specific will be learned should be avoided because they violate the principle of kevod ha-met – respect for the body of the deceased. Bet-Olam will write a letter for you to sign if you wish to object to an autopsy being carried out and will be there to guide you through this process.\nState law does not require embalming in most situations, and does not permit it without the expressed permission of the next of kin.\nBased on the biblical verse “For dust you are, and to dust you shall return” (Gen.3:19), embalming or the use of cosmetics is not a traditional Jewish practice.\nIf there is a need to identify the deceased, Jewish tradition is to do so in private. The coffin is then closed and remains closed throughout the funeral.\nJewish tradition is to bring a stone or a pebble to a grave as a symbol of the eternal nature of memory and of the soul. This also reflects the metaphor that flowers are much like the body in that they wilt and die. Some would invite those who wish to bring flowers to donate to a charity in lieu.\nPlots at the Jewish Memorial Gardens can be reserved years ahead for the interment of named individuals.\nIf the family wishes to reserve the grave next to their loved one, Bet-Olam staff can organise this when the funeral is booked.\nArrangements can be made for a grave to be dug to a depth of five foot, seven foot or nine foot which allows for one, two or three interments.\nWhether burial or cremation, it is Jewish custom to keep the coffin as simple as possible, without elaborate handles or trimming. This centuries-old Jewish tradition reflects the significant realisation that in death there are no differences of wealth or status. All of us leave this world as we enter it – without adornment or decoration. For the same reason, the body of the deceased is dressed in a simple white shroud. Traditionally no jewellery is buried or cremated with the deceased and nothing else is placed within the coffin. If a family wishes the tallit and kippah can be placed in the coffin.\nBet-Olam offers you the following suggestions which you might find helpful.\nFinally, remember that a eulogy should be a celebration of a person’s life.\nAttending a funeral is not something you do every day – so it is natural you may not be sure what to say or what to do. Please ask the funeral director if you need any assistance at any time.\nBet-Olam Jewish Funerals conducts most burial services at the graveside. We suggest that the immediate family arrive at the cemetery 15 minutes before the start of the service.\nAt the appropriate time, we will then invite all mourners to gather at the graveside, with the immediate family sitting. Bet-Olam Jewish Funerals staff will then walk from the roadside to the grave carrying the coffin, which will be placed on two bearers over the grave.\nThe Rabbi will begin the service, and at a point during the service, Bet-Olam staff will lower the coffin. A small sachet of soil from Israel will be given to the principal mourners to place into the grave and then the Rabbi will invite family and friends to each place three shovels of soil into the grave.\nThe Rabbi will then continue with the service and if there is to be a minyan, the Rabbi will announce this.\nAt the conclusion of the service, the principal mourners will be invited to gather at the roadside to enable others to speak with them.\nPlease note that if the deceased belonged to either VAJEX or a Masonic Lodge often a representative of either organization will conduct a short service at the same time.\nMost of the cremations conducted by Bet-Olam Jewish Funerals take place at our chapel on the corner of Glenhuntly and Kooyong Roads, Elsternwick. If the family wishes, the service can be conducted at one of the chapels at Springvale Botanical Gardens.\nAt the appropriate time, mourners are invited into the chapel. As mourners walk in, they will see the coffin on either a dais or a trolley at the front of the chapel.\nThe Rabbi will begin the service, and at a point in the service the coffin will either be respectfully taken into a separate room or – in the case of Springvale –slowly lowered into a cavity. In both cases, at the conclusion of the service and after all mourners have left, the coffin is then taken to the crematorium.\nAt the conclusion of the service, the principal mourners will be invited to gather outside the chapel to enable others to speak with them.\nAshes can be collected from Springvale and can either be buried under a bush in Jewish Memorial Gardens, kept by the family or scattered.\nBlack is not compulsory attire for a funeral. You should dress in a way to show respect to the family and to the person who has passed away. Women are welcome to wear pants and are not required to cover their heads. Bet-Olam Jewish Funerals will always have spare kippot to hand out to anyone who wishes to wear one. The most important thing is not how you are dressed but that you are there.\nShould children come to a funeral?\nParents are the best judges of whether their child is old enough to comprehend death and whether attending the funeral will be meaningful to them. It is important that children be allowed to express their grief and to share in this important ritual. Children can be naturally uplifting to those in grief, a hopeful reminder of the future. A suggestion for young children is that they might like to do a drawing, photo collage, photo album or write a letter to their loved one who has passed away. This often gives children a feeling of participation in the service.\nIf a young child becomes noisy, please walk away so as not to disturb the dignity of the service.\nThe traditional expression by the Rabbi to the mourners at the conclusion of the funeral service is “May God comfort you among the rest of the mourners in Zion and Jerusalem”. The customary greeting at a funeral and at prayers following a funeral is ‘Long life’, a paraphrase of the Hebrew expression ad me’a ve-esrim ‘May you live to 120’ (120 years, the life-span of Moses, being considered the absolute limit of life).\nSometimes people who are bereaved may feel that they need help to come to terms with their loss, to restore equilibrium to their life or to deal with some of the difficult emotions. These emotions – depression, anger, sadness, loneliness – often accompany the death of someone close and form part of the process of mourning. Very often support can be found from within the synagogue’s caring community network. If necessary, the Rabbi can give information and advice on specialist agencies.\nMourners traditionally ‘sit shivah’ for seven days beginning on the eve after the funeral. The exception to this is to attend synagogue on Shabbat. During this first week of mourning, the community comes to the mourners, attending to both their material and their spiritual needs by bringing food and prayer to the home.\nThe minyan enables the mourners to recite the kaddish prayer. This prayer is an expression of faith in God who gives life, even while facing the reality of death.\nThough the custom of sitting shivah strikes deep psychological chords, it can also be seen as a pattern for dealing with the first days of grief. Some will wish to have prayers at home for the whole week of shivah (excluding Friday evening); some for three or four nights; and others for only one night. Sometimes the gap between the death and the funeral influences how shivah is observed.\nMany mourners choose for the minyan to be held in the synagogue rather than at home. Some are more inclined to be with their grief in private, while others want to surround themselves with friends. Again it is important to stress that in Progressive practice there are no set rules about which Jewish traditions will provide the right relief at the right moment.\nIf the minyan is held at home, the synagogue arranges to supply siddurim (prayerbooks). The usual format of prayers for the minyan is the evening service, followed by the Memorial Prayers, and the Mourner’s Kaddish.\nDuring this service it is a good opportunity to invite relatives and friends to share their feelings, memories and experiences of the deceased.\nIn general the purpose of the visit is not to ‘cheer up the mourners’ artificially (or to be unnaturally gloomy), but to be with the mourners in their feelings, and to allow them to share them if they wish, or to keep silent if they prefer.\nWhen someone dies, a number of people and organisations need to be told. This may help you to finalise the affairs and ensure you receive the help you need.\nYou may download the following checklist. It shows you many of the people and organisations you may need to contact.\nIf you wish to have the name and telephone number of the person who died removed from mailing lists, you can ask the Australian Direct Marketing Association to do it for you."

The full presentation can be found on The statistics that have been published section of this website.\nIn April 2014, the Director of Public Health Science at NHS Health Scotland and two Professors of Public Health wrote to NRS, to ask it to match the ethnic information that was provided when deaths were registered in 2012 with what was recorded in the 2011 census for the same people, in order to assess the accuracy of the information that was recorded at death registration (and also to carry out similar work in respect of later years’ deaths, in order to obtain an ongoing measure of the quality of the data).\nThe data linkage part of this project was the first such piece of work done by the newly-established Data Sharing and Linkage Service, which is now part of the Scottish Informatics and Linkage Collaboration. As a ‘pilot’ project, it took much longer than would now be the case because of the need to establish various sets of rigorous governance, administrative arrangements and technical procedures. Not until May 2016 could NRS link together the ethnicity data from the death registration records for 2012 (and 2013 and 2014) and from the Census records (if any) for those people. A report on the results of the analysis was published on 14 March 2017.\nThe report concluded that the data on the ethnicity of the deceased person were not (at present) suitable for calculating reliable mortality rates for most ethnicities. It identified some ways that NRS could try to improve the quality of future data. The full report is available in The quality of the data for 2012 to 2014 section of this website."

        "text": "An eagerly awaited report from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that processed meats such as bacon and sausages cause cancer, and red meat likely does so too.\nThe France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the WHO, put processed meats on the top of their “things that cause cancer list”, grouping them alongside tobacco, asbestos and diesel fumes, for which there is “sufficient evidence” of cancer links.\nAlong the years, there have been many studies that linked processed and red meats with cancer (especially bowel cancer), but there were always some doubts floating about. Now, the 22-member panel analyzed animal experiments, studies of human diet and health, and cell mechanisms that could lead from these meats to cancer.\nThe decision wasn’t unanimous though, and a “probably” still crept in to the report. Many studies show the links, both in populations of people and in tests that show how eating these foods can cause cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said in its report, released in the Lancet medical journal.\nThis could give you cancer. Photo by Niklas Rhose.\n“Overall, the Working Group classified consumption of processed meat as ‘carcinogenic to humans’ on the basis of sufficient evidence for colorectal cancer,” the report reads. “Additionally, a positive association with the consumption of processed meat was found for stomach cancer. The Working Group classified consumption of red meat as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’,” it added.\n“The experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent,” the IARC said. “For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,” said IARC’s Dr. Kurt Straif.\nRed meat was included in a lower category, which means that while there is evidence for it causing cancer, there is still quite a lot of room for debate. But while processed meat seems to be decidedly bad for your health, not everybody is convinced about red meat.\nThe $95 billion U.S. beef industry has been preparing a retaliation for months, and they’ve been rallying numerous scientists to their cause – even some unafililiated with the meat industry.\nFor now, the takeaway seems to be this: you need to stop eating processed meat. They have a number of damaging effects, including elevating stroke risk, raising cholesterol and, of course – cancer. If you absolutely can’t give it up, then reduce it. Quantity does matter, and less is, while not ideal, better than more. The same goes for red meat – if you must have it, don’t have it every day. It’s not sustainable, it’s bad for the animals, and it’s bad for you.\nWe’re getting to a point where science is starting to understand what’s good for us and what’s not. Let’s make the science count, shall we?"

I haven't gone with Carnival, but most things are the same.\nAnyone have any info about Israel cruises? Just heard aof a short-term 3 day going to cyprus. Looking for something similar after simchas torah?\nDid you ever do the cruise?\nAnyone have any leads on kosher cruises for this summer departing from Israel, or tips how to find discounted prices?\nHas anyone had any experience with Kosherica cruises?\nYes, I actually worked as a mashgiach on a kosherica cruise. it was a one week cruise leaving and returning to Miami. It was a smaller group of kosherica members, only about 120 out of couple thousand passengers.\nJust have in mind when you do go on a kosherica cruise you will be getting 5 star food. The food is literally incredible. (im not advertising for them at all, just did one cruise with them). You are also paying uton more then going on a regular cruise but the food is truly amazing. Passengers come just to have the food, sit and indulge in anything imaginable for one week.\nAs for the islands, I do not think it is smart to pre book a excursion with the cruise liner, with a bit of research before hand or even on the island you go to visit you can book it your self for probably a quarter of the price.\nIf you have never been on a cruise it is a amazing vacation. I cant stress enough that everyone should go!!! Its incredible.\nany questions feel free to ask ill help with what I can.\nCouldn't agree more with you. I have also worked as a Mashgiach on a Kosherica cruise, from Seattle to Alaska in the summer last year. Out of about 2,500 passengers there was a group of about 75 Kosherica guests. The food you will be getting if you are a guest with them, is amazing, complete 5-star service, the best food you will ever have in your life. I can't stop thinking about the braised boneless beef shorts ribs that we had friday night, out of this world.\nStarting from breakfast, there is so much to choose from, whether you like classical cereal and milk, bread with cream cheese, tons of salads, omelets, eggs, hash browns, waffles, pancakes they have so much and it just keeps on coming out. Every lunch is a full on buffet, with 5-6 different hot dishes, always 1 or 2 soups, lots of different salads and so much more. And at dinner every night, you are given a real good menu to choose from what you like, they always have 3-4 appetizers, 2 soups, 3-4 main dishes, and about 3 desserts to choose from. The waiters are also all super friendly.\nFor any foodie out there (Dan?) - this is the best possible kosher vacation you can give yourself.\nThere are lots of foods available that are kosher, but it won't be anything like the real thing. Fruit and veggies are usually ok, kellogs cereal, cholov stam chocolate milk, soft drinks, and some of the bread. This was from past Norwegian cruise experience.\nOne can check out cruisecritic.com for ideas and vendors other cruisers have used at particular ports.\nOne may also potentially want to book an excursion through the cruise line if you are planning a long trip and may miss the departure time (if you are with the cruise excursion, you will be fine).\nI took a Royal Caribbean (RC) regular (not kosher-specific) cruise in the Mediterranean.\nFirst off -- I found this article very helpful when dealing with the halachos of cruising -- but a few more issues came up that were not mentioned in the article -- which I will share below.\nRoyal Caribbean stocks up on its kosher foods when the ships are in this side of the world, then travels with the kosher food in deep freeze until needed. RC uses Weberman's for their meals. We found the selection to be much better than expected and the meals themselves better than airplane meals. To speed things up each, we pre-ordered for the following meal so we would not have to wait for them to pull the food from deep freeze, thaw and cook time. We made sure to explain that we needed the food brought to us sealed. In a previous post someone mentioned that each person was entitled to a single kosher portion per meal. We did not find this to be the case on our RC cruise. Even though we each ordered a single meal, our head waiter kept ordering extra options for us at each meal.\nWhile they did not specifically offer kosher breakfasts, there was, in actuality a lot to eat. Even though we were in the Mediterranean, the small boxed cereals hailed from the US with hechsherim on the boxes (for thos non-world travelers, you will often find familiar looking products in other countries produced by unfamiliar manufacturers and without the hechsher you expect -- always check first). They also had kosher peanut butter/ jelly/ some saltines (some were/ some were not) and fresh fruits and veggies. Between that and the supplies we brought along, we definitely did not starve.\nWe were very impressed with how RC treated us with regard to our food situation that we made sure to tip our waiter/ head waiter above the official tip scale.\nWe brought small grape juice cartons with us (I believe from Trader Joe's) for kiddush. We ended up eating shabbos meals with other frum people we met on the cruise (and you will meet other frum people) and they ended up ordering kosher wine for the seudah.\nThe cruise also had deep freeze rolls for lechem mishnah.\nOne issue we encountered that we had not thought about (or asked a shailah before the cruise) was regarding having food warmed up for us on shabbos. Typically, they will pull the kosher food out specifically for you and warm things up specifically for you before the meal -- and we just assumed that this would be an issue on shabbos. On Friday, we met with our waiters to ask if they would warm things up for us on Friday and then refrigerate it for us for the shabbos meals (so no hot food but no cooking on shabbos issues). They said that according to the food safety regulations, once the food gets cooked past a certain temperature, they cannot re-refrigerate. Understandable and we did not want to cause any issues. In the end, we had the food heated on Friday and we left the Fri night food cooling on ice in our rooms and had someone in a suite refrigerate our shabbos day food. Ask your LOR before your trip.\nIn the daily newsletter they announced that they would have Friday night services, should there be interest. They said they would provide 'Torahs'. FYI, Torahs were, in fact, photocopies of Friday night davening. RC provided a room and had a bunch of chairs set up. Many more people showed up than I expected. Poeple sat where they wanted, some separate, some family. A frum man led davening in our case, but your situation may be different. If you would only be comfortable with a frum person leading, make sure to get there early and offer your services.\nAfter Fri night davening, RC provided some Manischevitz wine for a group kiddush. They also provided a challah that they baked (not kosher).\nWe made a stop on shabbos (we can't get off, see above article or research tchum shabbos) and the frum folks who were left did not make up a minyan.\nCANDLELIGHTING -- I believe we lit/ made havdala via non-fire methods. Ask your LOR.\nok for all you looking for some info on Carnival Cruises feel free to reply to me at any time.\ni looked into a few things but all of this you would have to look into again at your cruise.\n1. Ice Cream, Milk, Butter, Margarine(Dairy!) Chocholate Milk, Lox (Caf K), Cereal. Lemonade. Hot Chocolate.\nall these products can change in a blink of an eye so you must check again.\nOther things we had daily was freshly sliced Cucumbers tomato mushrooms carrots and peppers and fresh fruit. We brought a NONSTICK pan to get eggs on the 9th floor egg station. just make sure you do some of the cooking like throw salt on it.\nIf you have kosher meals from Pomegranate or Seuda Double Wrapped you have to arrange with Guest Relations to get it delivered to the Boat. Bring a clear list with you for them and for yourself. You will have to go to the Hostess and tell them before hand 5:30 worked for us to heat up what you want daily or tell her the night before.\nThey have Kosher Food. from Weberman. you can review it on their website.\nTHEY DO NOT OFFER CHALLA Bread in all situations so prepare to bring. Weberman did not provide it!\nI found it better when i got off the plane in Miami i took a taxi to Walgreens at 41st and Pine Tree where you can pick up Kosher Wine and MANY MANY KOSHER PRODUCTS. Cheese Deli Cream Cheese. even a selection of a few kosher wines. (My Choice Barkan Cabernet Sauvignon) Buy Water bottles and Gatorade as they charge on board for these things.\nFor lighting Candles use a app called iZman which can tell you candle lighting times based on your current location at sea add a few minutes to that. lit on window sill. but stayed in room till went out. maybe you want to talk to your steward call him in your room and he will surely put it out after 30 mins or so and your ready to leave. just don't say anything ask him a question about the window or something.\nfor havdala and friday night don't forget to bring a tea lights and besamem spices. The Champagne glass was a nice glass to use for kiddish and havdala as it was around 5.5 ounces and a pretty cup you can order one free from room service.\nHeating up food on Shabbat can be an issue so We decided to have a early dinner at 6:15 as oppose to 8:15 so we can be sure the food started heating up before shabbat. For shabbat day we had veggies lox and then cold cuts.\nBUT i thought of a very good way you can get hot food if you want on shabbat for lunch if you want just make sure to confirm with your rabbi before hand as i will not take responsibility for this or anything I'm writing here this is only what i did and you can verify with your rabbi prior to the time of your voyage.\nThey have warming cabinets in the dining hall - you can ask them to heat up your food in there for a few hours as this is not a normal way of cooking it might be allowed.\nEnjoy! and any questions let me know. I did Western Caribbean on Carnival Conquest.\nCozumel, Belize, Mahogany Bay, Grand Cayman.\nps. Tips they pre-charge you $11 per person per day. when you get to the boat go to guest relations and tell them you want it refunded and you want to give the tips yourself.\nRecommended Amounts ($20-30 for your steward, $20 for your Waiter and $30 for your hostess) (I also gave $10 to maître d' and assistant maître d' and $5 to the bus boy that did my table) around $100 in tips as appose to $160 that i wonder if it goes to the right people.\nNorwegian Cruise Line to Alaska in the summer and was thinking to order a few of these meals to bring on the Boat.\nAnyone have experience with doing something like that on a cruise line?\nBeen telling Dan this for years. I discussed this in depth with him at a wedding over a year ago and described the 16 floor central lobby atrium with the 6 glass elevators, casinos, amazing quality and quantity of food, great minyanim and programming, and wonderful, friendly down-to-earth Kosherica owners.\nIf Dan loves Hawaii, then he'll really enjoy the Carribean. No packing, unpacking; no runway delays, airline noise/ear pressure.\nChallenging for children, however I think that it's such a great fit of travel, food, people, and paradise for Dan that I'd assist with finding the right babysitters for them to enjoy an amazing week on a Kosherica cruise. I've done the Celebrity, Norwegian, and Costa. Great experiences 24/7.\nI would probably do a western cruise faster than a Caribbean cruise, cleaner and fresher air. Like a cruise to Alaska in the summer or a cruise to Cabo/Mexico in the winter, Kosherica has both of them But definitely any cruise will be a great experience, i could personally only speak for NCL which i have done, but supposedly others (RC etc..) are great as well.\nWe did a Kosherica cruise to the Greek Isles last year and it was spectacular. It's every bit as good as people say it is."

The Jackson sister dropped off a new single called \"Made For Now\" featuring Daddy Yankee earlier this week, and the duo decided to take their talents to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. It was Jackson's first late-night appearance in 14 years.\nUnlike most performers, Jackson took over the entire set. She remodeled the stage with dazzling set pieces, and brought along a crew of dancers and musicians to complete the performance. Much like the music video, Jackson uses dances from Ghana, Nigeria, Grenada, Trinidad, and the United States to give the performance a worldly vibe.\nIn an interview withiHeartRadio, Jackson revealed that she has had a passion for Latin music for some time. \"I've always loved Latin music, and obviously, the African music is there and always been an influence,\" she stated. \"Coming from what Daddy Yankee does in reggaeton, it's inspiration. It's reggae music, which brings you back to the African vibe, the whole bit. It was really nice working with him. Growing up with different bodies of music [and] having so many kids in the family, I've been fortunate enough to have an eclectic library of music. [I'm] just doing something different that once again has been a love of mine, but still trying to do different things.\"\nMUSIC Janet Jackson & Daddy Yankee Perform \"Made For Now\" On \"Tonight Show\""

The hoops can be side-to-side in the front and rear, or front-to-back on each side. You connect the hoops together to increase the overall rigidity of your rack.\nThe primary bracket of the rack system is the corner bracket. With corner brackets, there are two types of joints.\nWhere a tubing section intersects another.\nFor applications where the racks will attach to a flat deck or pad, we have a base bracket. Rack uprights can also be bolted directly to the side of frames and trailer boxes.\nBegin by determining the shape and size of your rack. I do this by sketching planned rack. Then use the sketch to figure out the number of bracket needed and tube lengths.\nOnce you have received your brackets, the first step is cutting your piece to size. This could be done with a hack saw, but that would take some time. A better way to cut your tubing is using a 4.5” angle grinder with a cutoff wheel attached.\nAfter you have your tubing cut to length, lay the piece out on the floor the way they go together.\nThen going one section at a time, position the brackets at the joint positions, square the joints up and mark the bracket holes.\nThen painting can be as simple as a quick scuff up with 220 sandpaper, a wipe down with something like xlyene to clean and a coat or two of enamel rattle can paint.\nFinally, assemble everything with 5/16” x 2 1/4″ bolt, load up whatever you plan to load on your rack and get out for some fun."

Finding and implementing practical tools of efficiency, accuracy and simplicity into our laboratories to stay competitive and cost effective can be especially tricky when investing in new technology or change.\nWhen it comes to model, die and articulation “cost effective, efficient and accurate” are the essence of Monotrac — offering more capability, options, accuracy and efficiency than any other model system out there. The integrated articulator, with pinless cone matrix model base, allows a single pour “cast-in-place” set-up that is simple and fast while eliminating labor intensive pinning and basing procedures. Monotrac dies are easily removed and reseat with solid stable precision. Even lower anteriors, the thinnest of dies, resist lateral sway. Other key features of the Monotrac are the Flex Arm Hinge allowing natural excursive equilibration. The Plug-in adjustable vertical stops are easy to place and eliminate the need for a metal articulator set up. The Monotrac V2 is full range capable for all model and die needs in the lab. One system covers it all from refractory to section implant models to full round house, it can do it. Because Monotrac does not require stone basing, cross arch and linear secondary base expansion issues are non existent.\nThis tray provides the most accurate double bite impression attainable. The Occlu-Tray is a reusable stainless steel rigid tray that will not torque or flex thereby eliminating distorted impressions. Mesh is now eliminated with the Occlu-Tray rim design allowing maximum intercuspation or natural centric occlusion to be precisely replicated into the impression. A Monotrac “cast-in-place” set up ensures this accuracy is also replicated to the articulated model. Minimize remake headaches and reduce chair time with precision fitting restorations.\nDesigned for ultimate efficiency and to complete all model processing procedures in one location. The Monotrac Diamond Die Cutter and Processing Station features an adjustable height motorized diamond blade for quick, accurate die sectioning. The blue tabletop flips up instantly so it then can be used lathe-style for side cutting of models.\nThe convenient vacuum port located at the front of the station incorporates a built-in inverted air blaster that instantly removes dust and debris from the model die matrix cone holes.\nA removable magnetic dust shield with magnifier enhances efficiency and vision during model flash clean up and for bulk trimming dies. The station comes with fittings and adapters for hook up to laboratory vacuum and air pressure."

        "text": "A hammertoe is a toe that is bent because of a muscle imbalance around the toe joints. The imbalance causes the toe to bend at one or more joints, pushing the middle of the toe upward in a claw-like position. If you notice such changes, it is important to seek proper treatment. Hammer toes never get better without some type of intervention and the sooner it is treated, the better the outcome.\nHammertoes are more commonly seen in women than men, due to the shoe styles women frequently wear: shoes with tight toe boxes and high heels. Genetics plays a role in some hammertoes cases of hammertoes, as does trauma, infection, arthritis, and certain neurological and muscle disorders. But most cases of contracted toes are associated with various biomechanical abnormalities of the feet, such as flat feet and feet with abnormally high arches. These biomechanical abnormalities cause the muscles and tendons to be used excessively or improperly, which deforms the toes over time.\nThere is no single cause of hallux valgus. It most commonly runs in families but may skip generations. High heel, pointed toe shoes are not the primary cause of the hallux valgus but they do cause it to be painful. Pressure from shoes may cause bunions, corns and calluses to develop where there is hallux valgus deformity.\nNo matter what stage your bunion is in, you can be in pain. Though bunions take years to develop, you can experience pain at any stage. Some people don?t have bunion pain at all. Pain from a bunion can be severe enough to keep you from walking comfortably in normal shoes. The skin and deeper tissue around the bunion also may become swollen or inflamed.\nThe non-invasive treatments for bunions are many and include changes in footwear, icing the sore area, over the counter pain medications, orthotic shoe inserts, and weight management. If these conservative measures fail to arrest your pain and discomfort, your foot and ankle surgeon may recommend a bunionectomy or similar surgical procedure, depending on your condition.\nThere are dozens and dozens of types of surgery designed to address bunion deformities, and each have different indications. But in short, some procedures simply address an enlarged bump. Some simply address a crooked big toe. But in order to slow the return of the bunion deformity, most procedures aim to realign the big toe with the bone behind it, the \"first metatarsal.\" This would also realign the joint surfaces between those two bones. But even if the surgery is designed to realign the big toe, there are still many choices to consider. Some procedures are meant for a short first metatarsal and others for a long first metatarsal. Some are best when the foot is very unstable, others are based on the severity of the arthritis present. In fact, there are many, many factors to consider when designing a procedure to address a particular patient's foot, to the extent that what's involved in a bunion surgery not only varies from patient to patient--the procedures often vary even from a patient's right foot to the left foot.\nPronation occurs at the joint below the ankle, the subtalar joint. It describes the inward rolling motion of the foot just after it lands on the ground. This moment is called initial contact, which is part of the stance phase of the gait cycle. Urthotic Insoles are designed today specifically for different pronation patterns. When you pick your next pair of insoles, your pronation type is a very important factor in your choice.\nThe condition generally occurs in active children at early adolescence during rapid growth periods as the heel bone can grow faster than the leg muscles causing them to become tight and overstretched. Sever?s disease most often caused by inadequate footwear, playing sport on hard surfaces, calf tightness and biomechanical problems.\nAdolescents suffering from Sever?s disease usually complain of pain at the back of their heel which is often worse after exercising. It is most common between the ages of 10-12 in boys and 8-10 in girls due to the rapid growth spurts that occur during this time. It can however happen anytime up until the age of 15. Whilst most people present with pain worse in one foot, it is very common to have symptoms in both feet.\nYour podiatrist will take a comprehensive medical history and perform a physical examination including a gait analysis. The assessment will include foot posture assessment, joint flexibility (or range of motion), biomechanical assessment of the foot, ankle and leg, foot and leg muscle strength testing, footwear assessment, school shoes and athletic footwear, gait analysis, to look for abnormalities in the way the feet move during gait, Pain provocation tests eg calcaneal squeeze test. X-rays are not usually required to diagnose Sever?s disease.\nTo reduce the risk of heel pain or sore heels from Sever?s Disease. Only wear properly fitting shoes. A lace up shoe with a firm heel counter. Stretch calf and foot before exercising or playing sports. Properly taping the foot provides excellent protection and immediate pain relief. Wear shoe inserts or an over-the-counter orthotic. If the problem persists, consult your foot doctor.\nOther less serious causes of pain in the back of the lower leg include Achilles tendonitis or bursitis. To distinguish between these possibilities, your physician will take a thorough history and examine your lower leg to look for signs of a rupture. The presence of a defect in the tendon that can be felt, evidence of weakness with plantarflexion, and a history consistent with Achilles tendon rupture are usually sufficient for diagnosis. Your physician may also perform a ?Thompson test,? which consists of squeezing the calf muscles of the affected leg. With an intact Achilles tendon, the foot will bend downward; however, with a complete rupture of the tendon, the foot will not move. In cases where the diagnosis is equivocal, your physician may order an MRI of the leg to diagnose a rupture of the Achilles tendon.\nDebate remains regarding the best form of treatment for a ruptured Achilles tendon. The 2 options are:immobilisation or operation. A recent meta-analysis of scientific studies showed that compared to immobilisation, an operation reduces the risk of re-rupture and allows a quicker return to work. An operation is not without risk and these must be balanced against the benefit of a lower re-rupture rate. Both treatments involve immobilisation for 8 weeks.\nPrevention centers on appropriate daily Achilles stretching and pre-activity warm-up. Maintain a continuous level of activity in your sport or work up gradually to full participation if you have been out of the sport for a period of time. Good overall muscle conditioning helps maintain a healthy tendon.\nA patient?s legs may be different lengths for a number of reasons, including a broken leg bone may heal in a shorter position, particularly if the injury was severe. In children, broken bones may grow faster for a few years after they heal, resulting in one longer leg. If the break was near the growth center, slower growth may ensue. Children, especially infants, who have a bone infection during a growth spurt may have a greater discrepancy. Inflammation of joints, such as juvenile arthritis during growth, may cause unequal leg length. Compensation for spinal or pelvic scoliosis. Bone diseases such as Ollier disease, neurofibromatosis, or multiple hereditary exostoses. Congenital differences.\nIf conservative treatment fails to provide relief of pain and disability then surgery is considered. Numerous factors determine whether a patient is a surgical candidate. They include age, obesity, diabetes, vascular status, and the ability to be compliant with post-operative care. Surgery usually requires a prolonged period of nonweightbearing immobilization. Total recovery ranges from 3 months to one year. Clinical, x-ray, and MRI examination are all used to select the appropriate surgical procedure."

        "text": "Stemming from a San Diego dog bite injury case that occurred on June 18, 2011, Alba Corenlio and Carla Cornelio, owners of the pit bulls that mauled an elderly neighbor, are expected to stand trial for manslaughter, a felony charge of owning mischievous animals that caused a death and six misdemeanors relating to the attack. According to an article in the U-T San Diego, 75-year-old Emako Mendoza was viciously attacked by the two pit bulls when she went to the backyard of her home to get her morning newspaper. Mendoza lived next door to the Cornelios in Paradise Hills. The two pit bulls had gotten into her yard through a gap in the fence. After the attack, the two pit bulls and their three-week-old puppies were euthanized.\nThe attack was so severe that Mendoza’s left arm and leg left had to be amputated. The vicious attack had also caused her to suffer a heart attack. Months of rehabilitation did not improve Mendoza’s condition. She died on December 24, 2011.\nThe Cornelios will likely pose another seemingly plausible argument in their defense. They will likely argue that they should not be held legally responsible for Mendoza’s death because pit bulls are domesticated animals, and the rule is that owners of domesticated animals cannot be held liable for injuries caused by such animals. Assuming that the court considers a pit bull to be a domesticated animal, the Cornelios may be successful in their argument. However, as our Escondido dog bite lawyer is well aware of tort law, there is an important exception to this rule. If the owner of a domesticated animal has knowledge of the animal’s vicious propensities, then he or she will be liable for any injuries caused. Earlier hearings in this particular case have revealed that the Cornelios had knowledge that the dogs were dangerous because they had attacked a man walking his puppy on Christmas 2010. Thus, the Cornelios desperate hope of being released of any legal responsibility will likely be dismissed.\nAs demonstrated by this particular incident, a seemingly simple case in actuality contains several strands of legal complexities. Therefore, it is important to have a Oceanside personal injury lawyer help protect the legal rights of those who have suffered injuries in any kind of accident.

        "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court Just handed down a 7-2 decision in favor of the baker in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, saying that the baker had the First Amendment right to not bake and decorate a wedding cake for a gay couple as that violated his sincerely held religious beliefs.\nMost likely nothing. The decision is very narrowly tailored to where strongly held religious beliefs clash with other civil rights. The court was careful to note that the baker was willing to make a birthday cake for the gay couple, but not a wedding cake, as he felt that would violate his religious beliefs.\nThey pointed out that no one would expect that a \"member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds\" could be \"compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion.\" Yet, we wouldn't want to extend that protection to everyone and everything related to marriage. Could a chair rental company refuse to rent chairs to a wedding they disagreed with?\nUnder this decision, no. The court relied on the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop's description that a cake is an artistic expression and therefore covered by the First Amendment. The result would have been different if the baker \"refused to sell any goods or any cakes for gay weddings.\"\nThe person refusing has sincerely held religious beliefs.\nIf you, or one of your employees, has a strong religious belief that prohibits him or her from creating something for a customer, you're not required to do so. If it's an employee who has an objection, you would have to offer a reasonable accommodation to the employee to not participate in the speech-related activity.\nThis court specifically said this case does not decide all other pending cases involving the conflict between religious views and gay marriage, and they will have to be further hammered out in the courts. In other words, neither side should consider this matter resolved.\nThe big takeaway for business: You need to see both sides.\nThat consideration was compromised, however, by the Commission's treatment of Philips' case, which showed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs motivating his objection. As the record shows, some of the commissioners at the Commission's formal, public hearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, disparaged Phillips' faith as despicable and characterized it as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust. No commissioners objected to the comments. Nor were they mentioned in the later state-court ruling or disavowed in the briefs filed here. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission's adjudication of Phillips' case.\nIn other words, the court didn't believe that the commission looked at the case fairly, and as such, they couldn't trust the outcome of the decision.\nWhile your business doesn't do public investigations, you will have to investigate employee complaints regarding sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and the like. If you come into it biased against one side and with your mind already made up, you're doing it wrong. If you can't conduct an impartial investigation to make a well-reasoned decision, hire someone from the outside."

        "text": "Professional pictures are sure to be special keepsakes. Thus, one of the things in my to-do-list whilst I am visiting my hometown, other than bringing Baby Naomi to a Baby Spa house, is to take family studio photos with Baby Naomi. The perk of this time's family studio photo shoot was to do the photo shoot together with my best friend, her baby girl and husband.\nFrom the moment my best friend and I confirmed the slot for this joint studio photo shoot, both of us were beyond excited and really looked forward to a super-duper fun photo session.\nWeeks later, the D-Day finally came and it was on the second day my husband, baby and I arrived to Indonesia.\nI was expecting really fun photo session that're full of giggles, laughter and lots of \"Aahhh!\" \"Ooooh!\" \"So cuteeee!\" But no, they didn't really happen.\nTruth is, my friend and I (together with our husbands) had to sweat ourselves so much in attempts to make our babies smile and we almost could not relax or catch up during the whole photo session. We've danced, clapped our hands, made silly faces, sung favorite kiddie songs, shaken lots of rattle toys - you name it, to make our babies showcase their smiling faces in this rare opportunity. My friend succeeded in making her baby smile many times and I failed. Moreover, it was equally not easy either to calm our fussy babies who, at many points, were not cooperative and in their best mood to smile and strike a pose, unlike their Moms.\nAnyway, I was really surprised to see the final results of the studio photos when the photographer presented them to me two days ago. They all look so good and Baby Naomi, albeit her stingy smile, looks adorable and amazingly cute in all shots. In short, I selected all the photos that the photographer wanted me to choose and ended purchasing three extra pictures because I could not bear not keeping the soft copies of Baby Naomi's first studio photos.\nAfter this experience, I still want to take more and more studio photos with Baby Naomi in the near future. Taking studio photos is so addictive, don't you agree?\nOur first proper family photo.\nThanks for the headband, Aunt Astrid!\nMy bestie, me and our babies.\nMake sure your baby is fed and has taken his or her nap before the photo session.\nBring lots of toys to distract your baby's attention and entertain him or her during photo session.\nDon't hesitate to dress your baby in bright and solid color outfits for the picture day as they will photograph well. However, make sure that those outfits are comfortable for your baby to wear. Don't forget to bring the matching accessories too, if any.\nBring outfits (for parents) that match the color of the baby's outfits. You won't regret somewhat matching wardrobe choices for the family photo session.\nIf the photo shoot is taken in a completely new environment, give your baby a couple of days to adapt in the new place and get used to meeting new people before the photo shoot day. My mistake was to take Baby Naomi to a photo session a day after we landed to Indonesia. She was probably still tired from our long-distance overseas trip and was not used to be seen and talked by total strangers around her. As a result, she barely smiled and showed us her four pearly whites during the photo session.\nDon't forget to bring extra diapers, feed and so on in the diaper bag just like how we are out and about with baby as per usual.\nThe rests are own collection.\nso nice pic for u blog."

        "text": "The recession has officially come to an end in France, Germany, and more generally in Europe. But for the economists this does not mean a return to economic growth.\nOne might have thought that, with François Hollande, realism would get the upper hand, all the more so as the 0.5% growth mainly rests on 0.4% growth in household consumption … which is partly linked to bad weather, the lousy spring having made energy bills balloon. Growth without jobs or investment: France continued to destroy jobs – 27,800 in the same period, as against 8,300 in the preceding quarter. The government has not commented on that figure. According to Eric Heyer, an economist at the French institute for the economic situation, “lasting economic recovery can only come if there is investment. Today, there isn’t any.” Investment has indeed continued to fall, even though it is at a slower rate (a 0.5% drop in the second quarter, as against a 1% drop in the first quarter).\nThe same persuasive efforts are being made in Germany. With 0.7% growth, that is, 0.1% more than expected, and five weeks before the parliamentary elections, the German minister of the economy jumped at the opportunity. “Germans have every reason to be optimistic as to the future,” said Philipp Rösler. “We must continue on the same path that, until now, has brought success: solid finances, competitive companies, and a policy that opens up margin for maneuver,” tax breaks, the pet subject of his liberal party (FDP).\nWith all due respect to the minister and to German chancellor Angela Merkel, here again, the extent of the bounce back seems to be linked to unusual climate conditions and to the housing bubble, prices having rocketed by 10% since 2000 according to the minister of the economy. While the details of this growth will not be known before August 23, these springlike figures are partly to be explained by an adjustment effect, notably in the building trades, which had been sluggish for months due to a harsh winter. Moreover, the minister has not revised his 0.5% growth prediction for 2013 as a whole.\nCountries that remain in the red.\nAccording to Eurostat, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the 27 EU countries grew by 0.3% compared to the first quarter, a figure that is slightly better than the 0.2% growth expected by the economists. But four countries are mainly concerned by this recovery: France and Germany on the one hand, Finland and Portugal on the other. On the flip side, Italy, Spain, Greece and the Netherlands are still in recession. But this is enough for the European Commission’s propaganda: “A lasting recovery is now within reach, but only if we continue our response to the economic crisis on all fronts,” insisted the European commissioner on economic affairs, Olli Rehn, in his blog."

SurfaceScapes puts an interactive map on the Surface, which you can interact with by moving around specially designed miniatures. All of the rules you need to run the game (e.g. movement, powers, etc.) are built into the game, and you can interact with your character through a handheld device (e.g. an iPod touch or smart phone).\nPutting aside snide comments about 4E finally realizing its video game roots, I think this is pretty darn cool. As a GM, I love the idea of using Campaign Cartographer to create rich, beautiful maps, complete with sound effects and event-triggered background music, but it’s hard to pull off in the real world (not impossible, just challenging).\nSomething like SurfaceScapes could let you do all that, while simultaneously abstracting away all those crunchy RPG rules (as we already do every time we fire up Dragon Age, Fallout or Mass Effect). I think games like D&D (be it 3.x or 4.x) led themselves to this sort of digitization, and I could see the hobby moving in this direction someday.\nBut (and you knew there had to be one) … there’s a real problem with cost. These Microsoft Surface units cost upwards of $12,500 (see Wikipedia for cost estimates) making them unrealistic for most people’s weekly game, and putting them out of reach of most hobby stories.\nI also wouldn’t really want this to replace my conventional game — I like using my imagination for all of this, regardless of how cumbersome the rules can be at times. But would I rent one for an afternoon at my local super arcade? You bet."

ARC is staffed 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.\nUpon receiving a call, ARC’s professional assessment counselors will take information and consult with our nursing and medical staff to determine if the Older Adult Behavioral Health Program is the most suitable treatment option.. If so, the ARC counselor will schedule an assessment. If during the assessment it is determined that inpatient care is indicated, the ARC counselors will be responsive to that need and arrange for admission on a timely basis.\nBecause the Older Adult Behavioral Health Program focuses on short-term stabilization, we do not accept patients who need skilled nursing care (require feeding tubes, IV’s, or catheters).\nOur primary goal is to assess each patient’s needs and make appropriate clinical recommendations. That is why our staff of experienced, highly-trained behavioral healthcare professionals, including psychiatrists, social workers, nurses and counselors conduct a comprehensive multi-disciplinary assessment. that determines the patient’s daily routine and therapeutic activities.\nThe Older Adult Behavioral Health Program plan of care may include a variety of structured physical and creative group activities that help to control symptoms, orient and re-motivate the patient, encourage the highest level of independence possible, and enhance self-regard.\nEach day may include reminiscence and relaxation exercises, music and art therapies, as well as other leisure time activities. We schedule administration of medication, snacks, meals, and frequent hygiene breaks into each day.\nOur nursing staff is specially trained in providing geriatric care. They are experienced in providing assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADL), mobility, fall prevention, nourishment/hydration, and interventions used for making patients feel more comfortable and secure. We treat every patient with respect, dignity, and compassion. Caregiver support and education are integral to all treatment plans.\nThe Older Adult Behavioral Health Program provides a welcoming, therapeutic, spacious, and safe environment which is located in a separate part of our Adult Inpatient Services area. Bedrooms and bathrooms are newly renovated and wheelchair accessible. Visitors are welcomed here on a flexible schedule that includes both afternoon and evening hours, and special arrangements can be made when needed. Clergy may visit at any time.\nTo help ensure access to the high quality of care and treatment provided by the Older Adult Behavioral Health Program, we accept most insurance plans, including HMO’s, PPO’s, and other managed care plans. Also, we are Medicaid, Medicare, and Champus approved."

I love this country, even with all its problems, and as Winston Churchill once said, \"It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.\" Perhaps that is true...the checks and balances DO seem to work for us, over time, if a bit frighteningly unbalanced at any given moment.\nThen this image intruded itself into my mind, and would NOT go away. An argument with an old old friend forced my hand, at least internally, and I knew I had to paint it...the pivotal moment when the second plane hit the Twin Towers, and what has happened to us as a country since.\nLike almost everyone, I was deeply affected by that event, for a variety of reasons. It took a long time not to react to every plane that flew over, not to dread the news for fear of what might have happened next, not to fear for my friends and loved ones who were in harm's way. We lost a great deal of innocence and our sense of safety that day, along with thousands of innocent lives. The courage we saw in those who helped the survivors, and the caring between those people themselves was awe-inspiring. It affected us, and the world--and continues to affect us, for good or ill.\nAt first we DID pull together, as a people--here and abroad. What has happened since is increasingly painful. My painting is about that matrix.\nSo many decisions to be made, when tackling a subject like this...what size, what palette, what format, and more importantly, how much to spell out, what to leave ambiguous? It has not been a fun painting, or a relaxing one, but one I needed to do.\nAt first I thought I would not be able to bear to LOOK at it, and wondered how I could do a painting I'd have to hide from myself.

However, after series of test-run, it is confirmed that they achieved 250,000 transaction speeds per second, whereas the blockchain method handles only 5 transactions per second. This makes it 50,000 times faster on the first version of test and then to 100,000 times faster transaction speed.\nLower fees – You are aware with the transaction fees being levied on our bank accounts per transactions. Also, fees in maintaining credit cards and also transacting any form of fiat currency are usually hefty. Encrypcurrency supports a very low transaction fee almost to nothing. This is one of the major benefits of Encrypcurrency to the society. Individuals get to execute series of transaction home or abroad without noticing the transaction fee being charged due to its low to no cost compared to bank transfers.\nGlobal Acceptance & Accessibility – according to statistics, there are over 2.2 Billion with internet access and mobile phones with no access to traditional exchange. Therefore, these people are can easily access Encrypcurrency. However, Encrypcurrency will have a global acceptance points which is made easy for everyone to access. So, you don’t need an account manager or software for withdrawal, with just mobile phones and internet, you can assess Encrypcurrency.\nHighly secured – security is one thing that has always mattered in the financial industry. Encrypcurrency is offering the most security production block chiper algorithm in the world, a highly secured encryption algorithm used by the US NSA for over 40yrs. Blockchain only offers 1 layer encrypt but Superencryp Block covers a super layer encrypt. I advise you refer to this article, “Superencryp Block cipher, technology behind encrypcurrency”.\nFacilitate International trade – Encrypcurrency limits no one to the amount of transactions they make. The huge benefit of Encrypcurrency is that it facilitates international trade, meaning, you get to transact from any part of the world without hassle. Due to its global acceptance & accessibility, you can trade from any part of the world and as fast as possible.\nImmediate settlement – Encrypcurrency provides a quick peer-to-peer transaction eliminating every form of third party or central bank. This means, you don’t need to wait for weeks to confirm transaction before receiving or sending out money. The Superencryp Block technology is based on trust, and we trust the computer, so whenever users send out money, the transaction is represented online as a superencryp block. After this, then superencryp is broadcast to every dime in the network and those checkers in the FCN (Feistel Core Network) approve the transaction is valid by matching block. Finally, the superencryp can be added to the block, provides double security and transparent record before moving the money from “A” to “B” from FCN network. This process happens pretty fast.\nNo Inflation – Skipjack Encrypcurrency has been designed as a deflationary currency, so it has a strictly limited money supply. This is what the financial economy needs, however as a deflationary currency, it increases in value over time. In other ways, you can use it as a store of value.\nNo chargebacks – there is no chargebacks meaning any executed transaction can’t be reversed. Just as we file chargebacks on credit cards, it won’t be possible with the use of Encrypcurrency. This helps to depletes fraudulent activities.\nAlmost centralized – every cryptocurrency expert is aware that the key is being decentralized, but fail to understand the cons of being decentralized. Encrypcurrency can serve as both a decentralized & centralized. Encrypcurrency is decentralized in the sense that it is managed by its network which operates on operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. However, it’s centralized that the Encrypcurrency network has its own Feistel Core Network (FCN) which acts like a Central Bank to double check on transactions.\nAML KYC Policy – It is a requirement of Skipjack Encrypcurrency that you reveal your identity as KYC AML policy and it will make skipjack the world most secure and acceptable by any government and banks. In fact one of the prime goals of Skipjack is to avoid money laundering, terrorist to anyone, but still allow you to conduct a transaction. It is very like cash in that sense. However, it is possible for someone with significant dedicated resources (governments, police agencies etc.) to track your transactions by examining in our public block chiper.\nThe above highlights are the major benefits of Encrypcurrency to the society. There are many other minor benefits but I believe I already cover the major ones. In no time, every local financial sector will adapt to this and boom!!!"

Sometimes when I’m looking at her, it appears that her mouth is moving, but nothing is coming out.\nIt’s nice to be able to take a long nap and not be disturbed by all her noise. Sometimes she scares me when she sneaks up right next to me so quietly. She’ll touch my ear and then I spring up, ready to run. I like to nap in the places where she walks most, so I can keep an eye on her and not miss anything.

        "text": "Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) reported record annual profit attributable to shareholders of $2.7 billion, or $4.52 per share, up 47% from $1.8 billion in 2010. Fourth quarter profit attributable to shareholders was $637 million, or $1.08 per share, almost double the $325 million, or $0.55 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\"2011 was another strong year for Teck. Higher average commodity prices combined with strong operating results contributed to new records for each of revenue, gross profit, profit and cash flow from operations. This allowed us to increase our annualized dividend rate to $0.80 per share. We ended the year with $4.4 billion in cash, which puts us in a strong position to advance our various expansion projects,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO.\nRecord annual revenues of $11.5 billion (up 25% from 2010).\nRecord gross profit, before depreciation and amortization, of $5.8 billion (up 30% from 2010).\nRecord annual profit attributable to shareholders of $2.7 billion (up 47% from 2010).\nRecord cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, of $4.6 billion (up 37% from 2010).\nRecord annual copper production of 321,000 tonnes (up from 313,000 tonnes in 2010).\nRecord material moved at our coal operations resulted in coal production of 6.7 million tonnes in the fourth quarter.\nWe achieved the lowest total reportable injury frequency in our history in 2011, representing an 18% reduction from the previous year and the fewest number of serious incidents on record.\nIn October, we announced a 33% increase in the semi-annual dividend on our Class A common and Class B subordinate voting shares to $0.40 per share.\nDuring the fourth quarter we purchased for cancellation approximately 4.8 million Class B subordinate voting shares for $171 million pursuant to our normal course issuer bid announced in June, 2011.\nTo date we have reached agreement with our coal customers to sell 5.3 million tonnes of coal in the first quarter of 2012 at an average price of US$230 per tonne. We expect to conclude additional sales over the course of the quarter.\nThe Wintering Hills wind power project, in which we have a 30% interest, became fully operational in November, 2011.\nIn November 2011, the regulatory application for the Frontier oil sands project was submitted to the regulatory authorities, which is a significant milestone in advancing the project towards commercial production. The federal government subsequently referred the application to an independent review panel, allowing provincial and federal regulatory reviews of Frontier to be conducted in parallel. This has the potential to reduce the regulatory timeline while maintaining a thorough and rigorous review.\nIn January 2012, we announced an agreement to acquire SilverBirch Energy Corporation (\"SilverBirch\") for a net cash outlay of $435 million, which will give us full ownership of the Frontier project, including the Equinox property. The acquisition is subject to SilverBirch shareholder and various regulatory approvals and is expected to occur on or before April 16, 2012. This will increase our total contingent resource by 67% to 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen.\nThis news release is dated as at February 9, 2012. Unless the context otherwise dictates, a reference to \"Teck,\" \"the company,\" \"us,\" \"we,\" or \"our\" refers to Teck and its subsidiaries. Additional information, including our annual information form and management's discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2010, is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nOur continued focus on expanding coal and copper production is having a positive impact on our business and financial results. In coal, investments in new mining equipment, plant upgrades and people have resulted in substantial increases in material moved, which will permit increased coal production. Our investments at Carmen de Andacollo and Antamina have and will continue to generate increased copper production from those two operations and we continue to advance our other late stage copper development projects, particularly Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 and Relincho. We also seek to strengthen our energy business unit with the announcement of our proposed acquisition of SilverBirch Energy Corporation.\nWe enjoyed strong markets during the year, with record average prices for both coal and copper, though prices declined significantly as the year drew to a close. While there was a significant rebound in copper prices subsequent to year end, coal prices have not rebounded and coal markets remain weaker than those we experienced in the first half of 2011. Unit operating costs have also increased as a result of higher input costs, lower grades and higher stripping ratios at many of our mines.\nThe liability management transactions we undertook in 2010 have resulted in a significant decrease in our finance expense, despite a successful bond issue in mid-2011, which increased our debt levels. The proceeds of the bond issue, together with strong cash flow from our operations, allowed us to build our cash balance to $4.4 billion. This was after record investment in plant and equipment, increased dividends and share buy backs. Our anticipated cash flow, strong liquidity and cash position, together with access to capital markets, should provide the financial capacity necessary to fund our attractive portfolio of growth projects.\nAdjusted profit, which excludes the effect of certain transactions described in the table below, was $613 million, or $1.04 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $512 million, or $0.87 per share in the same period a year ago. The higher adjusted profit was primarily due to significantly higher coal prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes of zinc and coal.\nOther items affecting profit attributable to shareholders in the fourth quarter were a gain related to an increase in the fair value of our option to call certain of our high yield notes prior to their maturity, which resulted from declining market interest rates in the quarter. In addition, we incurred a one-time charge in connection with a labour settlement at our Highland Valley Copper mine. Pricing adjustments were minimal in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $38 million of after-tax positive pricing adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2010. Profit attributable to shareholders was $637 million, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter compared with $325 million or $0.55 per share in the same period last year.\n* Our financial results are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), which is now GAAP in Canada. This news release refers to adjusted profit, EBITDA and gross profit before depreciation and amortization, which are not measures recognized under IFRS in Canada and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS or GAAP in the United States. For adjusted profit we adjust profit as reported to remove the effect of certain kinds of transactions in these measures. EBITDA is profit before net finance expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization is gross profit with depreciation and amortization added back. These measures may differ from those used by, and may not be comparable to such measures as reported by, other issuers. We disclose these measures, which have been derived from our financial statements and applied on a consistent basis, because we believe they are of assistance in understanding the results of our operations and financial position and are meant to provide further information about our financial results to investors.\nOur business unit results are presented in the tables below.\nGross profit before depreciation and amortization from our copper business unit decreased by $102 million in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, as a result of lower copper prices and a one-time pre-tax $44 million labour settlement charge at our Highland Valley Copper mine. These items were partly offset by a 12% increase in sales volumes due to higher production levels and timing of shipments last year. Copper production in the fourth quarter rose by 5% to 89,000 tonnes compared with a year ago, primarily as a result of improved production at Highland Valley Copper, Carmen de Andacollo and Antamina. Copper prices averaged US$3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of 13% from US$3.92 per pound in the same period a year ago.\nGross profit before depreciation and amortization from our coal business unit increased by $209 million in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, primarily due to significantly higher coal prices. Lower sales volumes and higher unit operating costs partially offset the higher coal prices. Coal production was on target in the fourth quarter, increasing by 11% over last year to 6.7 million tonnes. This was the result of our significant investment in mobile equipment and workforce to implement our planned expansion. Unit cost of product sold in the fourth quarter, before transportation and depreciation charges, of $65 per tonne improved from previous quarters this year but increased by 20%, or $11 per tonne, over the same quarter of 2010 due primarily to increased contractor costs, higher strip ratios and significantly higher prices for diesel and explosives. Coal sales of 5.5 million tonnes in the fourth quarter were below production levels and 7% lower than the same period last year. The decrease in fourth quarter sales volume compared with the same quarter in 2010 reflects the weaker market conditions. Global economic conditions and softer steel prices have caused many steel producers to slow their production and be cautious in purchasing raw materials. While we continue to develop our production capacity, our plans allow for flexibility to adapt to changes in demand. We realized an average coal price of US$253 per tonne in the fourth quarter, which was lower than the record high prices achieved earlier in 2011, but still up 27% over the same period a year ago.\nGross profit before depreciation and amortization from our zinc business unit decreased by $25 million in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago partly due to lower zinc and lead prices and lower sales volumes from Red Dog. Zinc and lead sales volumes from Red Dog declined by 11% and 20%, respectively, as customers had accelerated deliveries of zinc and lead in the fourth quarter of 2010. Lead sales were also lower due to reduced annual lead production levels as a result of lower ore grades from the Aqqaluk pit. Refined zinc and lead production from Trail increased by 6% and 71%, respectively, compared with a year ago as a result of improved performance in all areas of the plant, increased throughput, and the impact of maintenance shutdowns in the fourth quarter of 2010.\nRevenues from operations were $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter compared with $2.7 billion a year ago. Revenues from our copper business unit were similar to the same period a year ago as higher sales volumes were offset by lower copper prices. Coal revenues increased by $219 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 due to significantly higher realized coal prices, partially offset by a 7% decline in sales volumes. Revenues from our zinc business unit rose slightly from a year ago as higher sales volumes from Trail were offset by lower volumes from Red Dog and lower zinc and lead prices.\n* Except for coal prices, the average commodity prices disclosed above are based on published benchmark prices and are provided for information only. Our actual revenues are determined using commodity prices and other terms and conditions specified in our various sales contracts with our customers. The molybdenum price is the price published in Platts Metals Week.\nThe table below shows our production and sales of our major commodities.\nIncludes pre-commercial production and sales volumes from Carmen de Andacollo prior to September 30, 2010. Production of copper contained in concentrate during the pre-commercial start-up period in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was 20,700 tonnes. Sales of copper contained in concentrate during the pre-commercial start-up in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was 16,000 tonnes.\nOur coal business unit represents our interest in six operating mines. We wholly own the Fording River, Coal Mountain, Line Creek and Cardinal River mines, and have a 95% partnership interest in the Elkview mine and an 80% joint venture interest in the Greenhills mine.\nCost of sales in the fourth quarter includes a $44 million one-time labour settlement charge.\nResults do not include a provision for the 2.5% non-controlling interest in Highland Valley Copper.\nThe decline in Highland Valley Copper's fourth quarter gross profit before depreciation and amortization was due mainly to a one-time labour settlement cost of $44 million for the new 5-year labour agreement ratified in the quarter.\nCopper production of 27,300 tonnes was 14% higher than the same period last year primarily as a result of additional mill throughput and both improved feed grades and recoveries. Higher grade production from the east wall of the Valley pit has started to become available below the recently completed buttress project and will be a significant feed source for the mill in 2012. Molybdenum production of 2.8 million pounds increased by 40% over the corresponding period last year primarily due to higher feed grades. Copper sales of 30,400 tonnes were 32% higher than the same period last year as a result of the higher production and timing of shipments.\nOperating costs charged to cost of sales were $171 million, double the comparable period last year. This was due to the effect of significantly higher sales volumes and the one-time labour settlement costs. In addition, a greater proportion of costs were capitalized as part of the mine life expansion program in 2010.\nConstruction of the $475 million mill modernization project that was announced last September has commenced. Detailed engineering is 12% complete and excavation work has begun. The project is expected to increase throughput by 10% and improve metal recoveries over the life of the mine, with completion expected in the fourth quarter of 2013. Permit amendments were received for both the Lornex extension project, which commenced overburden stripping in the quarter, and for upgrades to the tailings system. A new life of mine plan was also developed that will see the operation extend to 2026 at the expanded throughput rate. A $58 million tailings upgrade project was approved, which involves construction of new tailings disposal lines and a new cyclone plant. The expansion is not based on a technical report filed under National Instrument 43-101. Highland Valley Copper's annual copper production is estimated to range between 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of contained copper, depending on ore grades and hardness, for an average of 125,000 tonnes per year after completion of the modernization project.\nHighland Valley Copper production in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 105,000 to 110,000 tonnes of copper. Molybdenum production in 2012 is expected to be similar to 2011.\nIn addition to royalties paid by Antamina, we also pay a royalty in connection with the acquisition of our interest in Antamina equivalent to 7.4% of our share of cash flow distributed by the mine.\nThe increase in our 22.5% share of Antamina's gross profit before depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter was due to significantly higher copper sales volumes, which increased by 46%, partially offset by a 49% decrease in zinc sales volumes, and lower copper and zinc prices.\nTonnes milled in the fourth quarter were 3% higher than a year ago. The mix of mill feed in the fourth quarter was 67% copper-only ore, 22% copper-zinc ore and 11% bornite ore, compared with 60%, 31% and 9%, respectively, in the same period a year ago. Copper production, on a 100% basis, was 95,000 tonnes compared with 83,700 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of the higher proportion of copper-only ores processed in the quarter as well as higher copper grades and recoveries. As anticipated, zinc production decreased significantly to 47,600 tonnes from 77,400 tonnes in the same period a year ago due to a 28% decrease in copper-zinc ore processed in the quarter as well as lower zinc grades and recoveries. Molybdenum production was significantly higher in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago as a result of higher throughput of copper-only ores with higher molybdenum grades.\nIn early February 2012, as part of a major expansion project to increase ore throughput capacity to 130,000 tonnes per day, Antamina successfully commissioned ball mill number four, which is operating at 100% capacity. SAG mill number two remains in the commissioning phase, which commenced in December, 2011. The SAG mill is expected to receive ore feed in early February. In the flotation areas of the project, good progress is being made towards anticipated final commissioning of the copper and zinc flotation in March and the molybdenum circuit in June.\nAntamina has almost doubled its fleet in the mine with the addition of 30 haul trucks, two large shovels and other support equipment. In addition, the Antamina power system expansion was completed with the commissioning of a 55 kilometre power line and 200kv substation. Management continues to forecast a ramp-up to full productive capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2012. A final estimation of capital spending for the expansion will be determined at that time. The expansion is not based on a technical report filed under National Instrument 43-101.\nOur 22.5% share of Antamina's copper production in 2012 is expected to increase approximately 30% and be in the range of 95,000 to 100,000 tonnes as a greater proportion of copper-only ore is planned to be mined, which is expected to increase by approximately 50% in 2012. Our 22.5% share of zinc production is expected to be in the range of 40,000 to 45,000 tonnes.\nTCu% is the percent assayed total copper grade.\nResults do not include a provision for the 23.5% non-controlling interest in Quebrada Blanca.\nThe decline in Quebrada Blanca's gross profit before depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter was due to lower copper prices and reduced sales volumes as a result of a decline in production levels, as described below.\nQuebrada Blanca is now transitioning from a high grade heap leach operation to a lower grade dump leach operation and processing a greater proportion of dump leach ore in the quarter compared with a year ago. As a result, copper production was 18% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010.\nOn February 7, 2012, we announced that a new 46-month labour agreement was ratified by the workers' union. The new agreement replaces the agreement that expired in January and covers the period from February, 2012 to November, 2015. One-time settlement costs related to the new labour agreement were US$6 million, and will be recorded in the first quarter of 2012.\nQuebrada Blanca's production in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 65,000 to 70,000 tonnes of copper cathode.\nIncludes pre-commercial production and sales volumes from Carmen de Andacollo prior to September 30, 2010. Production of copper contained in concentrate during the pre-commercial start-up period was 20,700 tonnes for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Sales of copper contained in concentrate during the pre-commercial start-up were 16,600 tonnes for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.\nResults do not include a provision for the 10% non-controlling interest in Andacollo.\nThe decrease in Carmen de Andacollo's gross profit before depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower copper prices compared with the same period a year ago, partly offset by increased sales volumes.\nDuring the fourth quarter, concentrator throughput was 40,900 tonnes per day. Copper production in the fourth quarter rose 23% to 17,300 tonnes compared with a year ago as a result of higher ore grades and improved recoveries. The mill is now operating at higher rates compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 when commercial production commenced.\nWork continues on a study to examine adding more plant capacity to increase annual copper production to a range of 100,000 to 120,000 tonnes. The study includes drilling to confirm additional ore reserves and addresses the key issues of availability of process water and permitting requirements. The study is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2012. The planned plant throughput and production improvements noted above are not based on a technical report filed under National Instrument 43-101.\nThe labour agreement with the workers' union that expired in December, 2011 was replaced by a new 45-month labour agreement, ratified by the workers' union, which commenced January, 2012 and will end September, 2015. One-time settlement costs related to the new labour agreement were US$10 million, which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2012.\nCarmen de Andacollo's production in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 70,000 to 75,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate and 5,000 tonnes of copper cathode.\nDuck Pond's gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $10 million in the fourth quarter compared with $24 million in the same period last year. Copper and zinc production in the fourth quarter were 3,300 tonnes and 5,000 tonnes, respectively, compared with 3,700 tonnes and 5,800 tonnes, respectively, last year. The lower production was a result of lower grades and throughput. Copper and zinc sales in the fourth quarter were 3,800 tonnes and 7,700 tonnes, respectively, compared with 4,000 tonnes and 4,900 tonnes, respectively, last year. The lower gross profit was primarily due to lower realized metal prices compared to the same quarter a year ago, despite significantly higher zinc sales in the current quarter.\nCopper and zinc production for 2011 were 13,200 tonnes and 21,300 tonnes, respectively. This compares with copper production of 15,000 tonnes and 20,200 tonnes of zinc production in 2010.\nDuck Pond's production in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes of copper and between 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of zinc.\nWork continues on finalizing the feasibility study for the Quebrada Blanca hypogene project by the end of the first quarter of 2012. As indicated previously, production could average approximately 200,000 tonnes of copper and 5,000 tonnes of molybdenum per year in concentrates over a 30 year mine life. There is potential for higher production rates during the first ten years of operation, with production commencing as early as 2016. Infill and exploration drilling continue to produce encouraging results and a new resource and reserve estimate will be completed following the feasibility study. The project will face the same industry-wide cost pressures as seen on other large scale projects contemplated for development.\nAs part of the ongoing project work plan for 2012, the Social Environmental Impact Assessment (\"SEIA\") is expected to be submitted to the Chilean authorities during the second quarter. There are issues yet to be resolved during 2012, such as securing long-term power supply for the project and settling project financing arrangements with other shareholders. During 2012, partial funding of the project is expected to allow engineering to continue and the procurement of long lead equipment to begin so that the schedule for a 2016 start-up can be maintained.\nSubsequent to completion of the pre-feasibility study for the development of a 140,000 tonnes per day concentrator project, a feasibility study for Relincho was commenced in the third quarter of 2011. As per the prefeasibility design, production would average 180,000 tonnes per year of copper and 6,000 tonnes per year of molybdenum over the 22 year mine life, with higher production in the first five years. The feasibility study is expected to be complete by the first quarter of 2013. Exploration and geotechnical drilling are ongoing and a new resource and reserve estimate is expected at the completion of the feasibility study.\nSubsequent to the completion of the prefeasibility study in July, 2011 for the Galore Creek project, work on an advanced engineering program to consider additional development options was completed in the fourth quarter. As a result of this work, the partners have approved a $25 million work program for 2012 which will focus primarily on field work such as infill and geotechnical drilling to support these development options. Some additional engineering and environmental studies will also continue.\nGross profit before depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter was up 31% over last year due primarily to higher US dollar selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher unit cost of product sold.\nProduction for the fourth quarter increased by 11% compared with the same quarter of 2010. Movement of overburden that must be removed to expose raw coal in the fourth quarter was up 14% over last year. Our investments in mobile equipment and workforce, made to advance our expansion plans, have significantly increased our capacity to move overburden and expose raw coal. During 2011, we increased our haul truck fleet by 23 units and our shovel fleet by 2 units. In addition, we replaced 21 existing haul trucks and 3 existing shovels. This new large capacity equipment increases the overall productivity and efficiency of our mobile equipment fleets. We have also increased our workforce by approximately 500 people. We completed the expansion of the processing plant at our Greenhills mine during 2011 and the plant expansion at Elkview is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2012.\nOur production capacity has increased, giving us the ability to produce 24.5 to 25.5 million tonnes of clean coal in 2012. Actual production will depend on customer demand.\nThe decrease in fourth quarter sales volume compared with the same quarter in 2010 reflects the weaker market conditions. Global economic conditions and falling steel prices have caused many steel producers to slow their production and be cautious in purchasing raw materials.\nThe average coal price of US$253 per tonne in the fourth quarter was down from the record high prices achieved earlier in 2011, but still up 27% over last year. Market conditions turned downward in the third quarter and continued to weaken through the fourth quarter as uncertainty over the global economic conditions grew. By historical standards, however, prices for high quality steelmaking coal remain relatively high. We have agreed on prices with our quarterly contract customers for the first quarter of 2012. Pricing of approximately US$235 per tonne for our highest quality product is consistent with prices reportedly achieved by our competitors. As of the date of this release, we have sold approximately 5.3 million tonnes of coal for delivery in the first quarter at an average price of US$230 per tonne. We may choose to sell additional tonnage on the spot market, which would increase sales volumes, but such gains could be offset by delays in customer vessels. Vessel nominations for quarterly contract tonnage are determined by our customers and deliveries depend on vessels arriving at port as scheduled. The spread between the quarterly benchmark price and spot prices tends to widen in a weaker market. Additional spot sales or further delays to quarterly contract vessels could cause average pricing to decline.\nUnit cost of product sold in the fourth quarter before transportation and depreciation charges of $65 per tonne improved from previous quarters in 2011, but increased by 20%, or $11 per tonne, over the same quarter of 2010. This was due to increased contractor costs, higher strip ratios and significantly higher prices for diesel and explosives. We continue to experience cost pressures arising from general inflation in most of our input cost categories. Excluding the impact of the $40 million union labour settlement costs recorded in the second quarter, our unit cost of product sold continued to fall in each successive quarter of 2011, from $76 per tonne in the first quarter, to $73 per tonne in the second quarter, to $70 per tonne in the third quarter, to $65 in the fourth quarter. We will continue to realize unit cost benefits of higher coal volumes in 2012, although this benefit is expected to be offset by inflationary pressures on most of our input costs. We currently expect our 2012 annual cost of product sold to fall within a range of $72 to $78 per tonne, for our current production plans.\nUnit transportation costs were $33 per tonne compared with $35 per tonne in the same quarter in 2010 due primarily to lower port loading charges under one of our agreements. We currently expect our 2012 annual unit transportation costs to fall within the range of $34 to $38 per tonne.\nAs a result of the drilling program at our coal mines, we have expanded our high quality reserves by 62% from 665 million tonnes at the end of 2010 to approximately 1.1 billion tonnes, resulting in a $4 per tonne reduction in our per unit depreciation charge.\nThe feasibility study for the re-opening of our Quintette mine in northeast British Columbia is progressing. Additional work is ongoing to ensure water management plans are complete for inclusion in the permit application and to update the mine plan based on additional drilling. This information will be included in the study, which is now due for completion in the second quarter of 2012. Long-lead equipment items, including trucks, shovels and drills, have been ordered, preliminary on-site work has commenced and stakeholder consultation processes are ongoing. Assuming that permits are approved on a timely basis and that development proceeds as currently planned, the mine could be in production in the second half of 2013 with production ramping up to approximately three million tonnes per year.\nWork is ongoing to develop and implement selenium management plans for each of our six operating coal mines and for the Quintette project. It is also possible that permitting for current and future projects may be delayed or withheld until appropriate selenium management plans are developed and implemented. We have begun to implement a number of measures, including a water treatment plant, entailing expenditures of $72 million over the next 3 years, however, our plans are not yet complete and additional costs may be incurred, which may be significant.\nGross profit at Trail before depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter increased slightly over the same period a year ago due primarily to higher silver production and silver prices. Increased production and sales volumes for zinc and lead in the fourth quarter were offset by lower prices. Production of zinc and lead increased due to improved performance of all plants and increased throughput during 2011 compared with 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, production and sales volumes were affected by a planned maintenance shutdown of the Kivcet lead smelter and one of the two zinc roasters.\nConcentrate purchase costs were higher in the fourth quarter, which reflected higher silver prices and increased throughput compared with the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter, operating costs increased as expenses for energy and supplies increased consistent with higher production, although the impact was offset by lower non-routine maintenance expenses, which were higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the planned shutdown.\nTrail's production in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 280,000 to 290,000 tonnes of refined zinc, 85,000 tonnes of refined lead and 21 million ounces of silver.\nRed Dog's gross profit before depreciation and amortization decreased by $54 million in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year primarily due to lower metal prices and reduced sales volumes. Zinc sales volumes in the fourth quarter decreased by 11% compared with the same period a year ago as customers had accelerated deliveries of zinc and lead in the fourth quarter of 2010. Lead sales volumes decreased by 20%, partly reflecting reduced 2011 annual production levels and acceleration of sales in the fourth quarter of 2010.\nZinc production of 135,300 tonnes rose 4% compared with the same period a year ago primarily as a result of higher throughput. Lead production increased to 22,100 tonnes compared with 17,300 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2010 as grades and recoveries were affected when mining initial ore from Aqqaluk in the fourth quarter of 2010.\nFor the year, a new record was achieved for mill throughput at 3.67 million tonnes, 3% higher than the previous year. The higher mill throughput and zinc grades were partially offset by lower recoveries resulting in an additional 34,000 tonnes of zinc production in 2011, a 6% increase over 2010. Lead production for 2011 declined by 26,000 tonnes, as the higher throughput was offset by the lower grade and recovery of the near surface Aqqaluk ore.\nA major capital project was successfully commissioned in December with the installation of the two IsaMills in the zinc re-grind circuit. During 2012, circuit performance will be optimized to take advantage of a finer grind to allow for improved recovery of the Aqqaluk ore in comparison to processing the same ore through the older tower mills.\nZinc available for sale from January 1, 2012 to the beginning of next year's shipping season totals 205,000 tonnes. Zinc sales volumes in the first quarter of 2012 are estimated to be approximately 95,000 tonnes. All offsite lead inventories had been sold as of the end of the year.\nRed Dog's production of contained metal in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 525,000 to 545,000 tonnes of zinc and 70,000 tonnes of lead. In accordance with the agreements governing our development of the mine, the net profits royalty that we pay to NANA Development Inc. increases to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2012 from the current 25%.\nEngineering studies are ongoing to update the design basis for the project and improve the accuracy of the cost estimates in anticipation of a project sanction decision by the partners in 2013. Should the partners sanction Fort Hills (Phase 1), production is anticipated to start in mid-2016, ramping up to approximately 160,000 barrels per day of bitumen production.\nOur share of the 2011 Fort Hills spending was $54 million. Suncor, operator of Fort Hills, has provided a 2012 preliminary project spending estimate of approximately $800 million, which includes; engineering, site preparation activities, procurement of some long lead items and early works. Our share of the 2012 forecast spending would be $220 million, including our ongoing earn-in commitments.\nThe Frontier Project has been designed for up to four production lines with a total capacity of approximately 277,000 barrels per day of bitumen, the first two production lines are planned to have a production capacity of 159,000 barrels per day. The Frontier Project includes an option of developing Equinox as a satellite operation.\nThe Frontier Project regulatory application was submitted to regulators in the fourth quarter of 2011. Review and approval of the application is anticipated to take up to three years. On January 19, 2012 the Federal Environment Minister announced the referral of the Frontier regulatory application to an independent review panel. The Frontier Project requires various provincial and federal regulatory reviews. Conducting these reviews in parallel can streamline and improve the regulatory process, while maintaining a thorough and rigorous review.\nIn January 2012, we announced an agreement to acquire SilverBirch that will give us full ownership of the Frontier project, including Equinox. Closing of the transaction is subject to SilverBirch shareholder approval and regulatory approval. This agreement creates a simplified ownership structure for Frontier, provides an opportunity to explore new partnerships and other alternatives to move the project towards development, and reduces our exposure to oil sands leases not amenable to mining. If approved, it will increase our total contingent resources by 67% to a total of 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen. This transaction is expected to close in April 2012 and to result in a net cash outlay of $435 million.\nNo field exploration activities are planned in 2012 and the key focus will be on supporting the regulatory application review, consultations with stakeholders and ongoing engineering studies.\nA seismic program was successfully completed on the Lease 421 Area during the first quarter of 2011. Data acquired during the field seismic program should assist in planning future coreholes.\nTo date, a total of 59 coreholes have been completed in the Lease 421 Area. The results indicate 49 of the coreholes contain prospective oil sands that range in thickness from 10 to 40 metres (averaging 19 metres) with oil sand grades ranging from 9% to 18% by weight with 10-12% fines and overburden thicknesses ranging from 17 to 68 metres (averaging 39 metres). These results indicate the potential for a mineable resource, however, further corehole drilling is required to establish the quantity and quality of any potential resource and environmental baseline data collection is required to assess any future project potential.\nThe Wintering Hills wind power project became fully operational in November, 2011 with the installation and commissioning of 55 1.6 MW wind turbines. Our share of expected power generation in 2012 is 80 GWhs, which will result in 50,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets. The total investment in connection with the project is approximately $64 million.\nFinancing expenses were $169 million in the fourth quarter compared with $153 million a year ago. The debt interest component of our financing expense increased only slightly from $122 million to $129 million in the quarter, despite the higher debt levels that resulted from the US$2 billion bond issue earlier this year. The effect of the higher debt was largely offset by the ongoing effect of the liability management transactions in 2010 in which we replaced high yield debt with lower cost debt with staged maturation. Financing expense under IFRS includes interest expense on debt and additional interest components relating to pension and decommissioning and restoration provisions.\nOther operating income and expense includes items we consider to be related to the operation of our business, such as pricing adjustments from settlement receivables, which are further described below, share-based compensation, gains or losses on commodity derivatives, gains or losses on sale of operating or exploration assets, and provisions for our closed properties. Other operating expense, net of other income, was $117 million in the fourth quarter compared with $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Share-based compensation expense was $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $71 million in the same period a year ago. Large recoveries and expenses result primarily from increases or decreases in our share price. Pricing adjustments in the fourth quarter were minimal compared with positive pricing adjustments of $93 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, when there was a sharp rise in copper prices. We incurred asset write-downs of $30 million in the fourth quarter, resulting from provisions on obsolete plant and equipment and exploration properties. Provisions for our closed properties totalled $33 million in the fourth quarter compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.\nPricing adjustments from the sale and purchase of our various products are now included in other operating income (expense). These pricing adjustments were previously included in our revenue or operating costs as applicable. Sales of metals in concentrate or copper cathodes are recognized in revenue on a provisional pricing basis when title transfers and the rights and obligations of ownership pass to the customer, which usually occurs upon shipment. However, final pricing is typically not determined until a subsequent date, often in the following quarter. Revenue in a quarter is based on prices at the date of sale. These pricing adjustments result in gains in a rising price environment and losses in a declining price environment and these are recorded as other operating income (expense). The extent of the pricing adjustments also takes into account the actual price participation terms as provided in certain concentrate sales agreements. It should be noted that while these effects arise on the sale of concentrates, we also purchase concentrates at our Trail refinery where the opposite effects occur.\nThe table below outlines our outstanding receivable and payable positions, which were provisionally valued at September, 2011 and our receivable and payable positions provisionally valued at, December 31, 2011.\nNon-operating income (expense) includes items that arise from financial and other matters and includes such items as foreign exchange, debt refinancing, realized gains or losses on marketable securities and gains and losses on the revaluation of call options on certain of our high yield notes. In the fourth quarter of 2011, other non-operating income was $81 million, consisting of gains on the revaluation of our call options and foreign exchange gains. This compares with $224 million of other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010, which included debt repurchase and financing costs of $341 million partly offset by gains on the revaluation of our call options.\nIncome and resource taxes for the quarter were $311 million, or 32% of pre-tax earnings, which is higher than the Canadian statutory income tax rate of 27%. This was mainly due to the effect of resource taxes in Canada and higher tax rates in foreign jurisdictions.\nIncome tax pools arising out of the Fording transaction in 2008 currently shield us from cash income taxes, but not resource taxes, in Canada. Canadian Development Expenditure tax pools and tax loss carry forwards primarily generated by those pools are $8.4 billion. We remain subject to cash taxes in foreign jurisdictions and resource taxes in Canada.\nCash flow from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital items, was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter compared with $1.0 billion a year ago.\nChanges in non-cash working capital items resulted in a use of cash of $49 million in the fourth quarter compared with a $124 million source of cash in the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold a portion of our coal receivables, which reduced our working capital requirements by approximately $150 million.\nExpenditures on property, plant and equipment were $374 million in the fourth quarter and included $177 million on sustaining capital and $197 million on major development projects. The largest components of sustaining expenditures were at our coal operations which totalled $57 million. Major development expenditures included $15 million for preparatory stripping for Highland Valley Copper's mine life extension project, $38 million for Antamina's expansion, $10 million at the Quebrada Blanca hypogene project and $92 million at our coal operations. The expenditures at our coal operations are largely to enable us to incrementally expand production at existing operations.\nWe also made investments totaling $324 million primarily in a number of publicly traded companies in the fourth quarter.\nWe have committed bank credit facilities aggregating $1.2 billion, the majority of which mature in 2015. The current unused availability under these facilities, after drawn letters of credit, amounts to $1.1 billion.\nWe continue to experience volatile markets for our products. Commodity markets have historically been volatile and prices can change rapidly and customers can alter shipment plans. This can have a substantial impact on our business. The uncertainty over the ongoing economic conditions in Europe continues to have an effect on the global economy, and this may affect both prices and shipments to our customers.\nCommodity prices are a key driver of our earnings. On the supply side, the depleting nature of ore reserves, difficulties in finding new ore bodies, the permitting processes, the availability of skilled resources to develop projects, as well as infrastructure constraints, political risk and significant cost inflation may continue to have a moderating impact on the growth in future production. Although we are concerned about current global economic conditions, particularly in Europe, we believe that, over the longer term, the industrialization of emerging market economies will continue to be a major positive factor in the future demand for commodities. Therefore, we believe that the long-term price environment for the products that we produce and sell remains favourable.\nThe effect on our profit attributable to shareholders of commodity price and exchange rate movements will vary from quarter to quarter depending on sales volumes.\nZinc includes 285,000 tonnes of refined zinc and 595,000 tonnes of zinc contained in concentrates.\nForeign exchange translation gains and losses on our US dollar denominated debt arising from exchange rate fluctuations are not expected to have a significant effect on our 2012 earnings, as our debt level is expected to be designated as a hedge against our investments in US dollar denominated foreign operations and working capital items.\nCopper and zinc prices are currently trading similar to 2011 average prices. Coal market conditions softened in the third quarter and remained so through the fourth quarter. By historical standards, however, prices for high quality steelmaking coal remain relatively high. The fluctuations in the Canadian/US dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our profit and financial position. The Canadian dollar, to date in 2012, has averaged approximately $1.01 against the US dollar compared with $0.99 in 2011.\nOur copper production for 2012 is expected to be in the range of 350,000 to 375,000 tonnes as a result of improved production at our operations. This compares with 322,000 tonnes produced in 2011.\nOur coal production in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 24.5 to 25.5 million tonnes. Our actual production will depend upon improvements in customer demand for deliveries of steelmaking coal. Should deliveries not improve, we may adjust our production plans, depending on market conditions and the sales outlook. We have the flexibility to devote additional resources to pre-stripping in these circumstances.\nOur zinc in concentrate production in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 580,000 to 610,000 tonnes compared with 646,000 tonnes in 2011. Red Dog's production is expected to decrease by approximately 35,000 tonnes and our share of zinc production from Antamina will decrease by approximately 10,000 tonnes due to ore body sequencing. Refined zinc production from our Trail metallurgical complex in 2012 is expected to be in the range of 280,000 to 290,000 tonnes.\nAssumes successful closing of SilverBirch acquisition in April, 2012.\nSpending on development projects is expected to include $340 million for Quintette, $325 million for Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 and $300 million for Highland Valley Copper's mill expansion and extension stripping. The amount and timing of actual capital expenditures is dependent upon being able to secure necessary permits, equipment, supplies, materials and labour on a timely basis and at expected costs to enable the projects to be completed as currently anticipated. Some of these expenditures have not yet received all necessary internal and minority interest approvals.\nWe also expect to invest approximately $220 million as our share of costs for the Fort Hills oil sands project, which is accounted for as an investment in associates.\nThe sales of our products are denominated in US dollars, while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar. Foreign exchange fluctuations can have a significant effect on our operating margins, unless such fluctuations are offset by related changes to commodity prices.\nOur US dollar denominated debt is subject to revaluation based on changes in the Canadian/US dollar exchange rate. As at December 31, 2011, all of our US dollar denominated debt is designated as a hedge against our US dollar denominated foreign operations and working capital items. As a result, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising on our designated US dollar debt are recorded in other comprehensive income.\nThe Peruvian Government enacted a new mining tax regime effective October 1, 2011, which includes a Special Mining Tax, a Modified Mining Royalty and a Special Mining Burden. Our Peruvian affiliate, Compañia Minera Antamina S.A. (\"CMA\"), is operating under a tax stability agreement and is exempt from the Special Mining Tax and the Modified Mining Royalty until 2016. In the interim, CMA will be subject to the Special Mining Burden which applies to its operating margin based on a progressive sliding scale ranging from 4% to 13.12%, which is deductible in computing its Peruvian income taxes.\nIn October, the Canadian parliament substantively enacted legislation to remove the ability of corporations to defer income for tax purposes through partnership structures. The regulations allow for a phase out period over five years. The date at which this change will affect our taxes payable is dependent upon income levels in Canada.\nWe hold a number of financial instruments and derivatives, the most significant of which are marketable securities, foreign exchange forward sales contracts, fixed price forward metal sales contracts, prepayment rights on senior debt notes and settlements receivable and payable. The financial instruments and derivatives are all recorded at fair values on our balance sheet with gains and losses in each period included in other comprehensive income and profit for the period as appropriate. Some of our gains and losses on metal-related financial instruments are affected by smelter price participation and are taken into account in determining royalties and other expenses. All are subject to varying rates of taxation depending on their nature and jurisdiction.\nAttributable to shareholders of the company.\nAs at February 8, 2012 there were 576,597,478 Class B subordinate voting shares and 9,353,470 Class A common shares outstanding. In addition, there were 5,743,520 director and employee stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging between $4.15 and $58.80 per share. More information on these instruments and the terms of their conversion is set out in Note 14 of our 2010 year end financial statements.\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements as defined in applicable securities laws.

        "text": "\"... Still occupied... but... the URG is now UPDATED!!!!!!! YEAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!.... Why Am I celebrating? I still have work to do!\"\nOkay, I've read some of your command and bugs problem, so I've made this guide to summary up for temporary solution for now. I've might change it after a few weeks after Recorder's new update, or some new bug problem that needs to be testing. Hope this help.\n1 ) Don't uninstall a mod mid-play, especially heavily scripted ones. They mess up your save game slowly. Although there are some mod that are safe to remove, but you will still need to clean up your save after that. Use \"Save game script cleaner\", It's easy to use even for beginners: http://www.nexusmods...im/mods/52363/?\n2 ) Skyrim can only handle 255 mods. The game won't be able to load more than that, but there is a way to bypass that. You can merge multiple mod into one. They will give you a boost to performances and allow you to test out more mod without trouble! I highly recommend using one, remember to read the instruction: http://www.nexusmods...im/mods/69905/?\n7 ) Remember to clean your esp, especially the official esp. (Update.esp; Dawnguard; Hearthfire; Dragonborn). Also use LOOT to check if there are any esp. that needs cleaning. You can clean them by using TES5Edit, remember to go watch video on youtube for instruction for this one : http://www.nexusmods...im/mods/25859/?\n8 ) Resist the temptation of modding. This is the most difficult task that no man has ever succeeded it, but you must do it, otherwise you will hear your soul screaming: \"...f***...I accidentally break my game for immersion and slottiness...\"\nI'm looking at you MxR.\nWell that should be everything you need to remember about modding Skyrim. I know there's a lot of thing to digest but You'll get use to it in time.\n1 ) I can't find The lost file at *location name* ?\n2 ) \"SETSTAGE\" command for Recorder's \"LOST FILE QUEST\"? + I ACCIDENTALLY READ THE WHITERUN FILE, WHAT SHOULD I DO?\n-The \"Lost File\" quest console command is \"PPRecorderLostFilesQuest\", if you wanted to use the \"setstage\" command, use this for emergency ONLY if you somehow encounter a bug or accidentally read the file at Whiterun.\nEDIT: I saved you guys the trouble to figure out the stage command for the quest, hope this help for people who still have trouble with the quest.\n3) How do I get Omnico the Ball of Wonder?\n-If you can't get the spell tome through Recorder's Dialogue, than you can take it from her inventory, don't worry, You won't break her quest..\n3.5) OMNICO WON'T FOLLOW ME, IS THAT NORMAL?\n4) HOW ABOUT THE MISSING DRUNKEN DIALOGUE?\n5 ) I use option from *follower overhaul mod like AFT, EFF UFO, etc...* But she won't talk to me; Can't dismiss her; Can't Re-recruit her! What should I do ?\n-Don't try to control her with option from follower overhaul mod like AFT, IAFT, UFO, EFF,... Sometime it will destroy her AI, can be fixed by remove her from controlled or load from a save before you control her with them.\n6 ) RECORDER'S HEAD TURN BROWN (black)! WHAT HAPPENED?!??!?!\n8 ) (For Newbs) How do I let Recorder stay at my home whenever I dismiss her?\n-If you wanted to set Recorder to stay at your home whenever you dismissed her, only use \"My home is your home\" Mod or the \"2plus\" version for more up to date. Don't worry, it's compatible with her and most follower without a their own custom homing system. Don't use follower overhaul control to set her home cause the result won't be... pretty.\nOpen up \"Notepad\" and paste in the text.\nIn the \"Save\" dialog box, navigate to the Skyrim directory. Default directory locations are listed below.\nNon-Steam: \"C:\\Program Files\\Bethesda Softworks\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\" or \"C:\\Program Files\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\"\nAfter that, name and save the file. It is recommended you use a simple and appropriate name. For example, if you are using the \"All Obtainable Spells\" list below, name the file \"spells\". When saving the file, be sure that it has no file extension (i.e. rename the file and remove the \".txt\" from the end).\nStart up Skyrim. While ingame, open the console (default key: ~ or `). Type \"bat <file name>\", without quotes and using the name of your text file. Continuing the example from above, you would type in \"bat spells\" and the console will handle the rest, granting all obtainable spells to your character.\n10 ) I ask Recorder to \"wait\" but she keeps following me? What should I do?\n( PLAN A ) Use \"My home is your home\" as a place holder for the \"Relax\" option. Set her a home at a place you wanted her relax, than dismiss her for now. and you can come back to get her, buuuut you will still have to go back to the place where you wanted Recrder to stay when dismiss (unless you wanted her to stay the \"Sleeping Giant Inn\").\n11 ) *For newbs again* I don't like her body type, can I change it?\n12) I accidentally exit out the conversation when first meeting her and now her dialogue option is gone?

Low and behold she stopped bringing her kids and said bc the new boyfriend got laid off and could watch them. She didn't give me two weeks notice but said she would be here June 2 to pay. As you can all guess, she never came back to pay. Well I filed in small claims court after sending her multiple invoices by certified letter. Apparently the Judge Judy show found our case and she agreed to go on it.\nHer original balance was $77.18, I'm suing her for $782.18 after $5/day late payment fees. I didn't know that if I win the show will pay the judgement for her. So vacation here I come, along with my husband who the show is paying to travel with me. Bonus is his sisters live in California so we're changing the tickets they bought for our return and staying a few extra days!.\nI've learned to get money in advanced now.\nWe had another provider forum member appear on Judge Judy!\nI would so go on!!\nHow does 77 dollars owed turn into over 700 dollars ?\njust make sure you have lots of proof and paper trail and contract.\nI charge $45/day late fees, plus if I take a parent to court they pay for all my legal fees (court and attorney costs) plus any time I miss from work. An unpaid monthly fee in my daycare ($650-$700) could easily turn into THOUSANDS very quickly (non payment for a month would be about $1400 alone)!\nI would assume it would be late fees accruing for everyday that payment is late.\nIt turned into over $700 because she was supposed to pay on June 2nd and there is a $5 daily late payment fee.\nI totally understand the concept and point of late fees, but I do have to add that I did take a parent to small claims before and I won everything but half the late fees.\nThe judge said I had to stop charging the fees when I filed for court AND that realistically late fees shouldn't be charged beyond 30 days.\nI was told it was \"excessive\".\nHe also said the point of a late fee was to detour parents from paying late and charging fees that amounted to 500% more than the original bill was not something he could in good faith grant. I receive the original payment due plus 30 days worth of late fees, filing fees and substitute costs.\nThat's really good info, BC. Thanks!\nAll the utility companies in my area continue charging interest on unpaid bills for YEARS... until the bill, plus late fees is paid in full. Same goes for many credit card companies, student loans, etc.\nI personally feel just fine about continuing to charge a daily late fee until I get all the money owed to me... and I'd absolutely appeal a judge on this decision!\nApparently we (child care providers) aren't \"special enough\" to do that.\nI agree with you though.....unfortunately the judge didn't. If appealing my own win in conciliation court was an option, I may have thought about it.\nMaybe civil court is different. I don't know.\nI don't have cable so I totally missed when Kimberli's case aired...does anyone know if it is on youtube or how I could find it online?\nI missed it too! Hopefully it will re-air one day!\nI remember the case number was #4125 and it aired on February 1, 2013.\nI think someone posted a youtube link to it but I think the video no longer exists...I can't remember completely.\nMaybe you could search with the date and/or case number for it.\nI would say they can do so because it's in the original contract or agreement that is signed. If providers are able to put strong enough language in their contracts they may be able to do it as well. Most states allow interest to accrue on unpaid judgments, so if you can get it to that point you'll get interest, too.\nDon't you also get paid even if you lose, too? A few years ago I was sent a letter from the People's Court and win or lose the case I still would have gotten paid something plus all travel accommodations. I think it was $250 if I lost which would have been more than the $177 I had originally sued for. I never agreed to go on though."

History is full of examples of important ideas transforming mankind, such as monotheism, experimental science and double-entry bookkeeping (which led to the creation of partnerships and corporations, the building blocks of modern capitalism). Human beings are willing to make great sacrifices, including their lives, to defend or advance what they believe.\nFormal education is only one of many methods by which people receive and come to accept ideas. Much of what we believe comes from parents, peer groups or religious institutions. Armed with modern technology that puts much of the world’s library at our fingertips, we are also freer than any human beings have ever been to explore new ideas on our own.\nOver the past four decades, ideas such as deregulating markets and adopting pro-growth tax codes have become increasingly powerful in public policy. You may be used to thinking about them in a domestic context, but the real action has been overseas. Since the end of the Cold War, for example, 14 post-communist countries have adopted at least partial privatization of their social-security systems and 21 have adopted flat-rate income taxes. America has yet to do either. More generally, as China, India, Indonesia and other countries of the developing world began to replace command-and-control economies with market institutions in the 1970s and ’80s, their standards of living began to rise. In fact, since 1970 we have experienced the biggest, broadest reduction in global poverty in recorded history. Of course ideas have power.\nBut how do such ideas spread? It’s not just about insider influence or massive expenditure. In a 2013 study for the journal Comparative Political Studies of post-Cold War reforms in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the authors concluded that while the World Bank and other large institutions spent significant resources promoting pension privatization, they didn’t do the same for the flat tax, which was advocated primarily by independent scholars and small free-market institutes. Yet the flat tax was more broadly adopted. Closer to home, American politics has become a clash of ideas, not just a clash of industry sectors or regional cultures. Republicans are more consistently conservative than they used to be, and Democrats are more consistently liberal. A fiscally conservative Southerner who would have been a “boll weevil” Democrat in the 1960s is now a right-of-center Republican. A socially liberal Yankee who would have been a “gypsy moth” Republican is now a left-of-center Democrat.\nTwo scholars, Andrew Pickering and James Rockey, believe that those differences have been magnified by economic change. In a study in the journal Public Choice, they looked at government size and measures of public ideology for American states. They found that the relationship was stronger when incomes were higher. Back in the 1950s and early 1960s, ideology had little impact on state-government size, which didn’t vary much. As incomes rose, however, states began to make different decisions about how to respond, reflecting different prevailing ideologies. California, for example, taxed rising incomes at higher rates to fund more government programs. Texas left more of that income in private hands to spend.\nAs a result, we now have a new ideological conflict about state policy and economic growth. North Carolina is right in the middle of it. What’s the big idea? We’re about to find out."

Gemfibrozil should be used together with lifestyle changes such as diet, weight-loss, and exercise.\nGemfibrozil is a prescription medication used with diet and exercise to reduce elevated LDL (\"bad\" cholesterol) and triglyceride levels while raising HDL (\"good cholesterol\"). This medication belongs to a group of drugs called fibrates. It works by reducing the production of triglycerides in the liver and by causing an increase in HDL.\nGemfibrozil comes in tablet form. It is taken twice daily, 30 minutes before morning and evening meals.\nCommon side effects include heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea.\nGemfibrozil may cause dizziness and blurred vision.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nA medication similar to gemfibrozil has caused cancer, gallbladder disease, and stomach pain. Talk to your doctor about the risks associated with gemfibrozil.\nMedications can interact with certain foods. In some cases, this may be harmful and your doctor may advise you to avoid certain foods. In the case of gemfibrozil, there are no specific foods that you must exclude from your diet when receiving this medication.\nHowever, you are advised to eat a low-fat and low-choelsterol diet. Follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietition.\nGemfibrozil falls into category C. In animal studies, pregnant animals were given this medication and had some babies born with problems. No well-controlled studies have been done in humans. Therefore, this medication may be used if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the unborn child.\nIt is not known if gemfibrozil crosses into human milk. Because many medications can cross into human milk and because of the possibility for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants with use this medication, a choice should be made whether to stop nursing or stop the use of this medication. Your doctor and you will decide if the benefits outweigh the risk of using gemfibrozil.\nTake gemfibrozil exactly as prescribed.\nGemfibrozil comes in oral tablet form and is taken 2 times a day, 30 minutes before the morning and evening meals.\nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take 2 doses of gemfibrozil at the same time.\nThe recommended dose of gemfibrozil for adults is 1200 mg divided into 2 doses a day. It should be taken 30 minutes before the morning and evening meals.\nIf you take too much gemfibrozil, call your healthcare provider or local Poison Control Center or seek emergency medical attention right away.\nIf gemfibrozil is administered by a healthcare provider in a medical setting, it is unlikely that an overdose will occur. However, if an overdose is suspected, seek emergency medical attention.\nStore gemfibrozil at room temperature."

        "text": "Studies demonstrate that foot fractures are among the top common fracture injuries assessed by physicians. It’s not surprising considering the foot is comprised of 26 different bones. When any of these structures receive unexpected or repetitive impact, whether sports or trauma related, the likelihood for a foot fracture to occur increases.\nAt OrthoAspen, our elite-grade specialists are educated and experienced in treating foot fractures, utilizing the most innovative approaches. It’s our goal to ensure that our patients return to their active lifestyles as quickly—and as safely—as possible.\nIn addition to repetitive impact-related exercise such as running, jumping and similar sports-oriented activity, dropping a heavy object on the foot or abrupt force to the foot, can cause fractures.\nMuscles, tendons and ligaments support the bones and joints of the feet. This is what enables them to withstand the entire body’s weight while walking, running and jumping. Even despite this protection, trauma and stress can cause fractures in the foot. Extreme force is required to fracture the bones in the hindfoot. The most common type of foot fracture is a stress fracture, which occurs when repeated activities produce small cracks in the bones.\nThis type of fracture affects the heel bone and occurs mostly as a result of high-energy collisions. It can cause disabling injuries, and if the subtalar joint is involved, it’s considered a severe fracture.\nThe talus bone helps to transfer weight and forces across the joint. Talus fractures usually occur at the neck or mid portion of the talus.\nNavicular fractures are rare and include mostly stress fractures that occur with sports activities, such as running and gymnastics, because of repeated loading on the foot.\nThis type of fracture occurs due to excessive loading on the foot, which leads to stretching or tearing of the midfoot ligaments.\nTo properly evaluate a potential foot fracture injury, your OrthoAspen physician begins by reviewing your medical history and performs a thorough physical examination of your foot. Imaging tests such as X-rays, an MRI or a CT scan may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Navicular fractures can be especially difficult to diagnose without imaging tests.\nTreatment depends on the type of fracture sustained. Whenever possible, our OrthoAspen Foot and Ankle team will attempt to apply conservative treatment methods.\nMore severe foot fractures may require surgery. If your OrthoAspen surgeon suggests surgery, a surgical procedure will be performed to align, reconstruct or fuse the joints (based on the specific type of fracture). Bone fragments may be held together with plates and screws.\nPhysical therapy is often recommended to improve range of motion and strengthen the foot muscles. Weight-bearing, however, should be a gradual process with the help of a cane or walking boot. Our ultimate goal at OrthoAspen is to get you back in motion following a safe and effective treatment protocol.\nIf you’re concerned that you may have experienced a foot fracture, simply click here to book a consultation with one of our expert orthopedic foot and ankle specialists, or call us anytime at 970-544-1289."

But how many of us live like we really believe that? We forget how absolutely needy we are of God’s grace. Second Peter 1 says, “His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness.” Did you notice the verb is the perfect tense: a definitive action that has occurred in the past with continuing results into the future?

        "text": "Vinyl has long been used to meet specific packaging needs due to its excellent transparency and high clarity, an ability to seal and sterilize and because it allows gas transmission important for some food products.\nVinyl (or polyvinyl chloride) packaging is used for clear, handled bottles such as for cordials; clamshells to protect fruit and vegetables, cakes and other food stuffs; and as film for wrapping and protecting fresh meat, dairy and deli products. It is also used as secure blister packaging for products such as batteries, razors, toys, pharmaceuticals and an array of consumer products, and as packaging for the safe delivery of medical products like intravenous fluids.\nHowever, vinyl packaging is a very small proportion (reliable data is hard to come by but it may be 2-4 percent) of all packaging materials (industrial and consumer) used in Australia . Most vinyl is used in long life products, particularly building products including potable water pipe, sewer pipe, conduit, cabling, flooring and window profiles.\nRigid vinyl packaging such as bottles and thermoformed packaging is recyclable when collected from kerbside and sorted from other polymers and packaging materials. Most councils around Australia have included these products in collections for many years.\nPost-consumer vinyl bottles are separated out where manual sorting systems operate at Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) and sent to recyclers. The Vinyl Cycle bottle recycling program that operated for many years until 2012 demonstrated that a recycling rate of over 50% was achieved when vinyl bottles were manually sorted for recycling; however, today very few MRFs operate such systems.\nOptical sorting technologies exist based on Near InfraRed cameras that can identify polymer types, including vinyl, and colours (except black). These achieve high purity streams, generally 93-96% for most polymers . In Australia, however, use of such technologies has largely been limited to identifying only the dominant two packaging polymers – PET and HDPE – despite local demand for recovered vinyl for remanufacturing within Australia.\nPost-industrial rigid vinyl packaging material such as thermoforming scrap, is sought after as a recyclate for use in other products.\nA successful program operates across Australia’s healthcare sector to collect flexible vinyl used in intravenous (IV) bags. The PVC Recycling in Hospitals scheme operates in over 160 healthcare facilities in Australia and New Zealand and collects approximately 15-20 tonnes a month of flexible vinyl packaging, tubing and oxygen masks. This material is reprocessed locally into new long-life products. The success of the program is in part due to the separation at source of the vinyl products, reducing contamination from other polymers and materials.\nUnfortunately, there is little if any collection and recycling of post-consumer films and food wrap, regardless of polymer type. This is due to high contamination from dirt and other non-plastic materials, the mix of polymers used to manufacture films including multilayer mixed polymer films and the risk of films entangling and damaging equipment. Nevertheless, the vinyl film industry in Australia has taken actions to reduce raw material use through down-gauging films and continually seeks ways to reduce the life cycle footprint of these products.\nClean, separated vinyl waste is relatively easy to recycle as vinyl is a thermoplastic. Vinyl’s melting point is relatively low which means less energy is required for reprocessing it than compared to other polymers, but this is the reason it is considered a ‘contaminant’ in other polymer streams as it burns at higher temperatures.\nThere is good reason therefore to implement technologies and systems to separate vinyl early in the kerbside waste sorting process.\nUsing recycled vinyl in new products replaces the use of virgin vinyl compound and reduces the carbon emissions associated with manufacturing virgin vinyl by about 80-85 percent. This significantly lowers the carbon footprint of new vinyl products.\nLocal manufacturers of vinyl products have indicated that they have an appetite to increase the use of vinyl recyclate if reliable, continuous sources of recyclate are made available. Signatory companies to the long-established PVC Stewardship Program are publicly committed to use recyclate in the products they supply to the market unless product standards prohibit it. The Council therefore welcomes initiatives by MRFs to separate rigid vinyl packaging and some flexibles for local reprocessing and reuse in Australia.\nPVC packaging is recyclable as it is collected by most councils and in the healthcare system, can be sorted into a defined stream, can be reprocessed and used as recyclate in new products manufactured in Australia, and has value.\nIn 2018, the Victorian state’s Metropolitan Waste and Resource Recovery Group (MWRRG) provided a $20,000 grant to part fund an investigation into the feasibility of recycling vinyl coated fabrics into roof tiles, one of the product concepts identified in Porject ReMake. The VersrTile project enabled an expert multidisciplinary team led by the Vinyl Council to design and test reprocessing techniques and form prototype roof tiles made from waste billboard skins. The project outcomes included testing the manufactured sample tiles, which found the tiles could resist weathering as required under applicable standards; however, further development is required on the tile prototypes to meet mechanical strength tests required for roof tiles.\nA preliminary business case has been developed to understand the financial and production factors that will be required to manufacture these roof tiles economically and to assess their commercially feasibility. The significance of this project is that it identifies a potential reuse of a composite material into a durable, high volume product without the need to separate the polyester fibre from the vinyl.\nRead our report VersrTile: Vinyl-Coated Fabric to Roof Tile Recycling Project (2018) here.\nA paper by one of the Vinyl Council's research partners, Dr. Sagar T Cholake, Research Associate, Centre for Sustainable Materials Research & Technology, University of New South Wales, has been published in the journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling Volume 136, September 2018 related to the Council's vinyl banner recycling project.\nThe paper, ‘Cost-effective and sustainable approach to transform end-of-life vinyl banner to value added product’ details a potential, new low-cost solution for waste PVC coated fabrics that does not require the separation of the PVC from the polyester fabric, overcoming a major barrier to recycling.\nTesting by the UNSW team indicated that waste PVC-coated banners could be used to fabricate strong and durable composite panels for multiple indoor and outdoor applications and the paper shows one example of final product.\nLife cycle analysis, conducted as part of the research, showed that replacing virgin PVC by recycled PVC from banner emits 78% less greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2 equivalent).\nAccess this paper through the online journal here."

The accident, near Thurso, claimed the life of Thurso man Michael Cameron. The other occupant of the Vauxhall Astra, which left the road and collided with a farm steading and a flagstone garden fence, early on Saturday morning, was Stuart McCulloch. His condition at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, was said to be “stable”, today.\nA SUPPORTING story on Page 1. warns people in the Far North to be “ready and waiting” to fight any proposed closure of the vet lab at Thurso. The alert comes from MSP Jamie Stone, after he received confirmation from rural affairs secretary, Richard Lochhead, that the future of the lab is under review. A year-long review of animal disease surveillance in Scotland has been carried out and it expected to recommend a reduction in the number of Scottish Agricultural College labs as well as changes in how the service is carried out. Mr Lochhead said it would be premature to speculate on the future of any facility or service and he gave an assurance that no decisions had been taken or conclusions reached “at this stage”. Officials are due to report their conclusions and recommendations, later this month.\nTHE third front page story record the multi-million pound boost Caithness received when it played host to the national Mod, in October.\nINSIDE, the paper reports, that according to a government report on the sinking of the Peterhead fishing boat Trident, off the Caithness coast, 37 years ago, no-one was to blamed. The report followed a fresh inquiry into the tragedy, presided over by Sheriff Principal Sir Stephen Young. He agreed with the findings of experts who said the most likely cause of the sinking was a sudden and catastrophic capsize.\nSTAFF and students of North Highland College UHI have showed planned educations cuts the red card. They staged a protest outside the Thurso campus, which impressed organiser, Fiona MacIntosh, the local convener of the teaching and lecturers’ union, EIS-FELA. She has started the campaign against funding cuts set for June, which she claimed could threaten the college’s future and has urged people in the county to back it.\nA REPORT by the Accounts Commission, criticises a corporate failure by Highland Council in the way the local authority’s handling of the controversial heating scheme in Wick. The report said the scheme, which could cost the council more than £13 million, had a number of weaknesses and criticises the lack of effective management of the project. It also highlighted aspects of the performance of two senior officers.\nA GLOBAL firm providing IT solutions and services is working to expand its Caithness workforce over the next two years. CSC’s local operation previously worked exclusively within the fence at Dounreay. While retaining some staff on the site, it moved its base to the Forss business park, over a year ago, which signalled start of a plan to grow the operation and diversify the business. Highlands and Islands Enterprise has been working closely to support the company in its plans to target new contracts across a range of sectors. The agency is now providing £37,500 funding to support the CSC Forss growth plan which aims to create 15 new jobs in the area.\nRESIDENTS in Ormlie are being invited to an open day to help shape the latest phase of improvements in the Thurso housing estate. Sheena Christie has just been appointed to spearhead the new, five-year plan to further transform the one-time council ghetto. The open day takes place on Saturday at the Ormlie Community Centre, between 1pm and 5pm.\nHOUSEHOLDERS are gearing up for a change to the refuse regime which will see the weekly general lift being replaced by a recycling collection, once a fortnight. Caithness and Lochaber are at the forefront of the changes following a trial in Skye and Lochalsh, and preparations for the new-look service have stepped up over the past week as the Highland council began the distribution of new calendars and information booklets.\nLOCAL fishermen are to take part in a pilot study to assess industry activity in the Pentland Firth and the waters around Orkney. The survey comes in the wake of proposals to establish tidal energy development off the coast of Caithness. Although Thurso creel fisherman, James Bremner, has not been contacted about the study, yet, he said he felt it would be a good thing, particularly if the findings from local crews are taken on board.\nRETIRED Lybster GP is gearing up for a test of endurance at this year’s London marathon. Peter Joiner will take to the streets of the capital along with thousands of others, for the gruelling 26 mile run, hoping to raise a substantial sum for the RNLI. It will also be something of a personal challenge for the 64-year-old who had three stents fitted into his heart, two years ago.\nTHERE was no lack of drama in Thurso, on Saturday night when Thurso Players came out on top at the district round of the Scottish Community Drama Association festivals of one-act plays.

        "text": "Bronkhorstspruit Dam Nature Reserve is a haven for waterfowl and the surrounding grassland attracts a number of interesting grassland endemics. Over 200 species have been recorded in the reserve and it is an excellent place to get to grips with some of the more common inland waders and grassland LBJ's. Visiting birders can expect to see some 70 species in a morning outing.\nRed-chested Flufftail, White-backed Duck, Great Crested Grebe, Orange River Francolin, Spike-heeled Lark and Red-capped Lark, Lesser Kestrel, Amur Falcon, Blue Korhaan, Caspian Tern, a variety of reed warblers, Wing-snapping Cisticola, Cloud Cisticola and Marsh Owl.\nThe centrepiece to the reserve is the large Bronkhorstspruit Dam itself and surrounding reedbeds. When the water level drops some areas of exposed muddy shoreline provide good wader habitat. Copses of exotic trees (mostly Eucalyptus) occur and grasslands make up the rest of the reserve.\nThe reserve is very popular with anglers, and an early start is recommended. Weekends and public holidays may be very busy. A relatively good dirt road runs from the entrance gate to the end of the dam, sometimes passing close to the shore and at other times going through the grasslands. There is a hide near the entrance gate and one can walk anywhere in the reserve. There are a number of camping sites along the shore, each with limited toilet facilities and a concrete braai area.\nApproaching the reserve, check the bridge area for Giant Kingfisher, Pied Kingfisher, Malachite Kingfisher, Greater Striped Swallow, White-throated Swallow, South African Cliff-Swallow, Little Egret and Hamerkop. This is a good area to spend half an hour waiting for waterbirds.\nThe next area to visit is the direct vicinity of the entrance gate. The exotic trees here are home to Bokmakierie, Fork-tailed Drongo and Red-throated Wryneck.\nAfter paying the entrance fee at the gate, turn right and head down to the (currently dilapidated) hide. The hide itself is not particularly good for waterbirds, but the reedbeds are full of Southern Masked-Weaver, Cape Weaver and Southern Red Bishop in summer, and Little Rush-Warbler, African Reed-Warbler and Lesser Swamp-Warbler are not uncommon. The general vicinity of the hide is sometimes good for Red-chested Flufftail and White-backed Duck, and Little Bittern is spotted from time to time. Patches of aquatic and marginal vegetation occur all along the shoreline, and are well developed where smaller streams enter the dam or where there are shallow depressions. The reedbeds and sedge beds and the grassland adjacent to them are good for Yellow-crowned Bishop and White-winged Widowbird in summer. They are also around in winter but are a lot harder to identify in non-breeding plumage. Other species that are often seen in such habitats are Marsh Owl, Common Waxbill, Orange-breasted Waxbill and Levaillant's Cisticola.\nIt is sometimes possible to drive upstream to the south of the entrance gate on a series of tracks ' please check with the staff at the entrance gate whether road conditions allow this.\nWaterbirds are common along the road parallel to the shoreline. In summer large numbers of Palearctic waders occur. Common Ringed Plover are present at times, and Kittlitz's Plover can be abundant when conditions are right. Others that are often found include Curlew Sandpiper, Three-banded Plover, Common Greenshank, Marsh Sandpiper, Wood Sandpiper and Little Stint. Larger waterbirds often congregate either in rafts on the open water or in flocks on the shore. White-breasted Cormorant and Reed Cormorant are common and African Darter occur close to reeds or other cover. Grey-headed Gull are usually around and visitors should keep an eye open for Lesser Black-backed Gull in summer. White-winged Tern and Whiskered Tern are usually to be found and Caspian Tern visits in winter. Osprey is also sometimes sighted. Great Crested Grebe are unusually common on the water in-between the Red-knobbed Coot, Common Moorhen, Little Grebe, Egyptian Goose and Yellow-billed Duck. Herons are also common; look for Grey Heron, Purple Heron, Black-headed Heron, Cattle Egret, Squacco Heron, Little Bittern, Black-crowned Night-Heron, Great Egret, Yellow-billed Egret and the occasional Black Heron. Also to be seen on the exposed shoreline are African Quailfinch coming to drink.\nThe grassland areas are home to a range of interesting LBJ's. Cisticola are common and of the smaller ones, Zitting Cisticola, Cloud Cisticola, Wing-snapping Cisticola and Desert Cisticola can be identified by their species calls. Northern Black Korhaan and Swainson's Spurfowl have similar crowing calls and can be heard in the early morning. Blue Korhaan are recorded annually. Long-tailed Widowbird are conspicuous in summer and Crowned Lapwing, African Wattled Lapwing and Blacksmith Lapwing are abundant. Rufous-naped Lark, African Pipit, Cape Longclaw and Red-capped Lark are the most commonly confusing species, but Pink-billed Lark and Spike-heeled Lark, Chestnut-backed Sparrowlark and Lark-like Bunting are sometimes present.\nThe reserve incorporates the southern section of the dam and the entrance is from the Bronkhorstspruit / Delmas about 40 minutes' drive from Pretoria. Take the N4 east and turn off at the Bronkhorstspruit / Delmas offramp. Turn right onto the R42 towards Delmas. After 3.8 km turn left to Delmas (R42). The entrance road to the reserve is found on the right after 13.7 km.\nAn entrance fee is payable at the gate."

        "text": "An earwax candle is a tool that is said to clear the ear of wax using heat conducted from the candle. There are safety issues involved with these candles, but many people swear that they work, and help with a variety of issues related to the ears and health.\nWhat Is an Earwax Candle?\nEar candling is the process of burning a special candle made of cotton, linen, or other natural cloth while the unlit end is placed in the ear. While the candle burns, it is claimed that earwax and other toxins are removed.\nWhat Stores Sell Ear Candles?\nThis process is also called ear coning. The earwax candle is made by winding the fabric into a tight, narrow cone with a hollow center, and then soaking the cone in beeswax so that it will harden and burn like a real candle.\nThe subject of the ear candling starts off by laying on one side. The ear candle is then placed into the ear, and the opposite end is lit. Sometimes the candle is first fed through a paper plate or other tray that rests on the side of the head, to catch the dripping wax and prevent burns.\nThe theory behind this practice is that the heat from the flame in conjunction with the suction from the opposite ear on a flat surface creates a vacuum. This in turn draws out toxins and dissolves earwax, collecting these undesired elements inside the cone. Each ear receives one or two candles, depending on how much wax and debris is thought to be present. The candles themselves are burned for several minutes at a time, then extinguished and relit.\nAfter the procedure is finished and the candle has burned down to about four inches in length, the remains of the ear candle are cut open. Inside there is always some black and yellowish debris, which is claimed to be the toxins and earwax. Critics of the practice say that this mess is actually just the result of the burning of the candle.\nThere have been reports of all of these things occurring during a standard ear coning. If you decide to try this method of removing excess earwax, proceed with caution.\nEach country decides whether certain products are safe to sell to its citizens, and ear candles have created some controversy. In the United States they may be sold, but manufacturers may not make any medical claims on the packaging or promotional materials.\nCanadian officials have banned the sale and use of ear candles in that country. In Europe, these candles may be sold and even labeled as safe to use.\nProponents of earwax candles insist that they not only help to remove wax, but also cleanse the inner ear passages and even help with sinuses and other bodily systems.\nCritics, however, claim that these candles can be extremely dangerous and don't actually help to remove earwax at all. Some people who have tried this practice have ended up with melted wax adhering to their ear drums, risking their hearing and requiring surgery to have the wax removed.\nBefore you decide to try an ear candle or have the procedure done by someone else, consider all of the risks. Look into traditional methods of removing excess earwax by asking your doctor about your options."

When you wanna treat yourself, you might nip to Nandos. Who doesn’t!? But there is more. Here’s the lowdown on 6 student budget places to eat in Coventry!\nRealistically, you should know about the Phoenix by now, because of its most convenient of locations: right there on the corner across from the Hub. This is the student spot, and so the prices and menu reflect that. The atmosphere is easy going for a drink and their wings and burritos aren’t bad either.\nTurkish restaurant (although it’s less of a restaurant given its size) Pasha is one many pass by and may not take notice of. Do not be one of these people. They make the food in front of you much like Subway, and they do some must-try wraps.\nWhile some might not know this exists, the likelihood is you’ve walked straight past a little gem heading into the City Centre. Located behind the cathedral, this swanky ‘establishment’ – an 18th century county hall/courtroom reflects its up-market image with higher prices and posher food. However, at lunchtimes, Monday to Friday, it’s 2-for-1 on burgers. So for the same price as a Subway and without the Subway queues, you can feast on a fat and juicy burger with fries and coleslaw.\nA chain restaurant you may have seen in other UK cities, Cosmo is an all-you-can-eat buffet like no other. While going at lunchtime means less choice than the evening, that doesn’t impact on the quantity as, after all, that’s up to and how much you can devour. Stack that plate up like the lecture handout pile growing on your desk in your room. Chinese and Indian cuisine on demand.\nTucked away into the detached shops of Far Gosford Street is Habibi. Middle Eastern halal cuisine served in an exotic Bedouin tent and garden out back. Habibi was voted one of the best veggie restaurants in the entire city and also allows your to BYOB (Bring your own beer, or of course, whatever else you prefer). Seeing as you probably walk past it on a regular basis, seems rude not to give it a try.\nThis is UnCOVered’s holy grail. Noodle Bar, or as we have nicknamed it, ‘Noody B’. You can get a succulent Chinese meal for a sweet low price. A generous bowl of quality food for literally £6/£7. Select a meat (or non-meat), a cooking style with vegetables/sauce and the type of noodles you want and then wait mere minutes. Prepared by the city’s fastest chefs, your order will arrive sharpish, and you will be satisfied. You’re welcome.\nLet us know if you try any of these after reading this guide, or if you already have!\nFind out more about student life here."

For META, the project team continues to process user-accounts that were missed in the previous rename efforts. KUMC is working to rename their accounts provisioned with the vfa, and aff suffixes. KUL is renaming the corresponding accounts to match. KUL and KUMC are also continuing work on a problem where KUMC students are being provisioned at KUL first, and then getting a KUL formatted user-account name. The project team will also resume discussions for data synchronization, so that phase 1 can come to a conclusion.\nThe Increase MFD Usage team has completed standard operating procedures for optimizing MFD usage across campus, and is now implementing these processes in lockstep with the Reorganize and Redefine IT Staff and organization team. MFDs are in use at a large computing lab previously leveraging laserjets and currently is trending as the 3rd highest printing lab on campus. There was a 1.0% decrease in MFD usage for the month of April 2015 versus April 2014 with an overall 4% increase from FY14 to FY15.\nThe Engineering Lead Programmer position will be reopened. KU IT will continue to work with CLAS and the School of Architecture, Design & Planning to reorganize and redefine IT Staff."

        "text": "After the excitement of Game of Thrones Season 5 being filmed in the Alcazar palace in Seville last October, and subsequently in Osuna’s bullring, the limelight has transferred to Almeria province this year, where filming of Season 6 will take place next month on the Almeria coast and in the Tabernas desert. This is the second season which has been filmed in Andalucia.\nStaff have been spotted preparing scenery in the area of El Chorrilo de Pechina in Sierra Alhamilla, where Exodus: Gods and Kings was also filmed recently, and the Faro de Mesa Roldan lighthouse near Carboneras. Sets are being constructed using materials specially prepared in Belfast and then transported to Spain, to be put together on location.\nThe Alcazaba in Almeria, the city’s Moorish citadel, is also to feature as a palace.\nAlmerian locations will represent either Dorne (as was the case with the Alcazar in Seville) or Essos.\nOther locations include the Muralla de Jayrán, and the Cautivo de Tabernas, where 100 horses will be used, making it likely that this location will be Essos, home to the Dothraki, a nomadic horse-riding warrior tribe similar to the Mongols.\nShooting will take place from 10 to 23 October, with 2700 extras being used – 1800 men and 900 women.\nSeason 6 is expected to air in April 2016, like previous seasons of Game of Thrones.\nTo see which movies were filmed around Almeria province, see our list of films shot in Andalucia. The other Spanish locations for this season of Game of Thrones (Juego de Tronas in Spanish) are Girona, in the north-east, and Peñiscola, in Castellon."

        "text": "5 Ways to Amplify Student Voice With Technology Educational technology tips for teachers, librarians and schools.\nWe talk continuously about student motivation, engagement, and achievement as education professionals.\nWe share countless anecdotes recalling forward thinking and activities that we believe captured the hearts and minds of our students.\nWe attend conferences and workshops around the country and select breakout sessions that promise to show us new ways of enticing them to participate in our selected activities ungrudgingly.\nWe do all of these things from a good place in our hearts because we truly care about our students, but we often forget about the most important element—student voice.\nIf we were to reflect on our lesson planning and curriculum development, how much influence from student feedback would we find? I don’t mean what you or I thought the kids would like or want to do; I mean which concepts, topics, and activities were added to the curriculum specifically because student feedback forms, interviews, or focus groups yielded those suggestions.\nThe key to the breakthrough we’re seeking in education rests in empowering our students and encouraging them to take an active role in their learning!\nModern education champions Bruner, Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, and the constructivist learning theory suggest that children acquire knowledge by being active participants in the learning environment.\nUnfortunately, a majority of classroom curricula and lesson plans reflect a more passive approach to the learning process in which adults control the content, topics, and methods of knowledge acquisition while students do what they’re told.\nWhat if we extended the Montessori method into upper grades and included students in the shared decision-making model by collaborating with them in the curriculum development process?\nWhat if we used technology as a vehicle for collecting student feedback and cultivating classroom learning while promoting student voice?\nWhat if our approach to education made student-centered span all facets including the curriculum writing?\nWe start small, but we must start.\nClassroom blogs offer students their own personal space to reflect on classroom practices, learning objectives, personal engagement, and a host of other topics. Curating blogs also provides ample opportunities for students to exercise peer review and practice feedback skills with one another.\nBuilding community online, as well as in the traditional setting, gives the relationship between you and your students, and students and their peers, another dimension.\nThe writing intensiveness of this activity is a plus too. Kids don’t need to blog every single day, but a few times a month keeps the novelty and boosts their engagement, especially if you tie in incentives.\nKidblog.org is education-friendly and has privacy measures specific to minors.\nOutside of school, students have communities of friends and family with whom they exchange conversation and ideas on a daily basis. When they’re in school, they often retreat to their “circle of friends” without interacting with others.\nCampus-wide use of a safe, free, tech tool like Edmodo can bridge that communication divide within and among grade levels, even branching out to other campuses. These online groups and promoted discussions give teachers and administrators new information and insights into what students would like to see and do within the classroom.\nEdmodo looks quite a bit like Facebook, which is helpful for navigation, but there’s far more security and it’s strictly for teachers, students, and parents. As an added bonus, the platform has Office365 and a number of apps that users can access for studying and enrichment purposes.\nI can’t stress enough how excited students get when they walk into the classroom and see the response pads (clickers) on the desks. Something as small as being able to point a remote at the board and give an answer with the touch of a button makes them want to complete the day’s lesson.\nMore importantly, teachers and administrators can employ clicker technology to collect large numbers of student opinions and perceptions. These can be used in school and classroom modifications, which reinforces the value of student voice and adult appreciation.\nCompanies like Turning Technologies are well equipped to outfit your campus with clicker sets if you don’t already have them.\nSometimes creativity gets lost in the classroom. Luckily, there are many ways to get it back while being an advocate for student voice.\nIn the age of Instagram, SnapChat, and “selfies,” students are more than familiar with cameras, filters, and retouches. To harness this, have students create photo journals about major topics in the community or world, including text discussing how they feel and what they think about it. This is a fun way to foster technological fluency while nurturing students’ personal expression.\nToday’s cell phone cameras can take million-dollar shots, but if your library also has a set of digital cameras or newer iPods, consider building a yearlong photo journal project centered on student voice.\n365project.org gives students a free place to upload images and create their photo journal that can be set to private. Don’t hesitate to look through the other apps and resources to find the best online journal for your students.\nI might be dating myself here, but consider using “Confession Booths” like MTV’s Road Rules and Real World or modern-day reality television shows. The process is simple: Set up a webcam or regular video camera in a secluded corner of your room and allow students to take turns sharing their thoughts with you throughout a particular unit of study.\nAt the end, have different groups of kids edit the footage using iMovie, Windows Media, or another editing tool and produce their own mini-documentary/confessional. The final products can be uploaded to SchoolTube as student voice projects.\nYou can also use the videos to reflect on your unit and plan revisions you want to make based on student response.\nThere are several ways to begin promoting active student engagement in the educational process, and these tech tools are just a few of them. We have a gold mine of ideas and achievement waiting to be tapped via student feedback, and with a bit of planning and front-loading, we can use a variety of tech tools to encourage students and amplify their voices within the field of education."

        "text": "I’ve been blogging about our farm since 2006 and today marks the beginning of my weekly blogging for 2014. I’m really off and on during the off-season, but, since this is the first week of the CSA, I consistently write about farm issues and provide news from Lida Farm every week as well as provide information about what’s in the CSA box with a recipe.\nLike a teacher looking at the new school year, I’m always a bit apprehensive about a new growing season. Will first box be ready in time? How do the veggies look? Will insect pressure overwhelm us? How about weeds? Weather? Stress? Kids? Oh, boy, no matter what’s thrown at us, the season is started and there’s no turning back for the next four months.\nPutting together the box for today, however, a lot of those beginning of season fears fall away as the lettuce looks really good as we’re harvesting, there’s more broccoli than I thought, and, yes, we actually got a cultivation in with the tractor before this weekend’s rain. A sign which gave me even greater comfort was the garter snake which surprised me this morning near the lettuce patch. Like any reptile or amphibian, the snake is a sign of good health and I appreciate their presence even though I’m deathly afraid of them. It was almost as if he made his appearance today to welcome us to a new season.\nArugula (bunch of greens with elongated oak-like leaves): I like these in pasta or raw in a Italian-style salad with olive oil, balsamic, and parmesan cheese…you can also make an arugula pesto.\nPlace arugula in a food processor or blender with the garlic, nuts, salt and about a 1/4 t. pepper. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and pulse a few times. With the motor running, add additional olive oil to make a creamy sauce. Use within a day.\nWe like to add cheese and use it as a substitute for traditional basil pesto with pasta. You can also throw in some of the parsley to make the arugula taste more mild. Bittman suggests using the pesto on grilled chicken or shrimp.\nThe veggies are growing, although not at the rapid clip one would expect this time of year. We were able to cultivate once with the tractor so far just before a rain about ten days ago – that first rain was much appreciated but it doesn’t seem to want to stop. Rain keeps out of the fields and we just stand by and watch weeds grow.\nStill, we are making headway. Last weekend’s heavy rains gave us a nice opportunity to really dive into work in the high tunnel where all our cherry and some specialty tomatoes are planted. We hoed, weeded, trellised, and mulched all eight rows and things look great. It’s now just a matter of giving them some time, and, in that environment which plants love (they are kind of like couch potatoes in the high tunnel), they will get as tall as me and just pump out tons of perfect tomatoes. I really can’t wait."

Atlantic westerlies dominated in December with Storm Deirdre on the 15th.\nThe first week of December was mild and unsettled with low-pressure systems and associated weather fronts traversing the country frequently in a mainly westerly airflow. This gave rain or showers every day with windy conditions at times, especially on the 7th and 8th. The second week continued with the generally unsettled theme, although less active on the 9th and 10th, as a transient area of high pressure moved over the country. High pressure established itself over Scandinavia on the 12th and the airflow over Ireland backed to south or southeast up to the 15th. The bulk of the rain during this period fell in the South. On the 15th, Storm Deirdre deepened rapidly as it moved across the country giving widespread heavy rain and very strong winds. The remainder of the third week was Atlantic dominated again in a south or south-westerly air flow with rain or showers on most days. It settled down towards Christmas as high pressure built from the south over the country giving a mostly dry Christmas and final week of the month and year."

        "text": "Was it a surprise to you that you were given the arts and culture position?\nNo, there is no surprise when you are a cadre of the ANC because you are deployed anywhere. You are given a five-year contract to do a portfolio and when you are finished, you wait for another one. At no stage do you have a say.\nWhat qualities do you bring to the position?\nPeople say to me you are a minister here but you can’t sing; how can you survive in the sector? It’s not about that.\nIf you attend some of the meetings of the ANC, you will see that I lead revolutionary songs. I know I can command a revolutionary song.\nI will be working with stakeholders and cultural activists and we will be going on a journey together. We will bring our understanding and our connection with young people.\nThis is an area that is, by and large, filled with practitioners who are young, with hopes for the future and dreams.\nWhat would be important would be to bring that strategic leadership to the sector, primarily to co-ordinate the endeavours that have been started by my predecessors.\nWhat are the first things you will tackle?\nOn my first day I had a briefing on what has happened in the department and what we need to do. I immediately raised the issue that we are writing the true history of South Africa through the voices of its people, rather than through colonialists.\nWe need a single national monument where everybody who comes to South Africa will be able to understand our history. It has to be brand- new. No nation has come through what we have come through without that kind of recognition and national monument.\nSouth Africa has a very rich history that needs to be taught properly. Things such as the Anglo-Boer War need to be taught fully, so that we would see that it was a South African war where everyone had a role. There is this strong feeling I have that it is important that we acknowledge all our history.\nOne thing we have to do is measure the contribution of arts to the big picture. Take for instance the yearly jazz festival in Cape Town. When people go there they talk about one aspect, which is tourism, but they forget that at the core it is arts and culture. They go there to connect spiritually with their needs. It is very important. I also want more people coming here to produce movies.\nI see arts as helping a young democracy that is competing with old democracies. We are still finding our way. I want to see South Africans being given an opportunity to reflect on themselves on a yearly basis. Heritage is very important because this is where we are grooming our people to understand [our cultural history]. By identifying young people and giving them a chance to study, we are creating a reservoir for the future.\nWe must also find a way of promoting all our languages. Some of them are seen as being inferior, which is a mistake. We also have to develop our unofficial languages, such as that of the amaPondo. When we develop them we are saying: ‘We understand your culture, we know who you are and we want to see you prospering.’ It is a huge task.\nI do not have a favourite because my point of view is that of an internationalist, where I listen to music from around Africa – Senegalese and Congolese music – and the world. I particularly enjoy jazz and soul. When I sit down to reflect and take stock I listen to jazz, and on a really bad day it is soul music. I like Richard Nwamba’s African Connection [programme on SAfm]because it brings that music from across the continent. It’s a pity that it is only once a week; I would like to have it during the week too.\nWe need to take better care of our artists. They entertain us and they become our celebrities, but in the end they die in very difficult circumstances. We need to improve their lives. They helped us to attain freedom and they are creating a new South Africa. Look at kwaito, which was an initiative of young people without anyone guiding them.\nDo the arts get enough financial support?\nI still have to see the fullness of the sector, but I would probably want arts to have more concentration in the sector. I am not sure it would only be financial. If you go to other countries, arts and culture are the things that unite people. They play a big role, like with sports and recreation.\nI am excited because of the potential that I feel we can unearth here. This is a junior department to others, but what can be more senior than leading a nation to identify itself? A nation that does not understand its soul is not worthy to be called a nation.\nAre there limits to freedom of expression? What about The Spear painting?\nOne area that we really fought for very hard is what is contained in the Bill of Rights: people have to express themselves. When you do that, you would be responsible and not express yourself to incite violence. When it comes to The Spear I can’t say it is up to the minister to say what people must express. Whatever we do as a nascent demo-cracy, we must respect others.\nI’m taking my point of view from the values of ubuntu, with the caring and sharing of Africans.\nBut other people have their own views.\nAre you going to any shows this weekend?\nI am going to the office as we speak for consultations, and I will still be doing that this weekend. Obviously I will be going to any events that I can, because you can’t be something that you do not understand fully. It is one of the perks.\nWe have become a crass, materialistic society to the detriment of our most important needs – our spirits and our emotions. We cannot continue that way, because we are missing that sense of belonging."

        "text": "I love Google – they send me stacks of traffic and make sites like Booko reach a far greater audience than I could effect on my own. Recently, however, Google’s taken a bigger interest in Booko than usual. These kinds of numbers are no problem in general – the webserver and database are easily capable of handling the load.\nWhen this request comes in, Booko will check to see how old the prices are – if they’re more than 24 hours old, Booko will attempt to update the prices. Booko used to load the prices into the browser via AJAX – so, as far as I can tell, Google wasn’t even seeing the prices. Further, Booko has a queuing system in place for requests to look up prices, so when Google requests pages, this adds a book to the queue of books to be looked up. Google views books faster than Booko can grab the prices, so we end up with 100’s of books scheduled for lookup, frustrating normal Booko users who see the problem as a page full of spinning wheels – wondering why Booko isn’t giving them prices. Meanwhile, the price grabbers are hammering through hundreds of requests from Google, in turn, hammering all the sites Booko indexes. So, what to do?\nThese commands will drop all Google traffic.\nThe next step was to go to sign up for Google Webmaster Tools and reduce the page crawl rate.\nTo make Booko more Google friendly, the first code change was to have book pages rendered immediately with the available pricing (provided it’s complete) and have updates to that pricing delivered via AJAX. Google now gets to see the entire page and should (hopefully) provide better indexing.\nThe second change was to create a second queue for price updates – the bulk queue. The price grabbers will first check for regular price update requests – meaning people will get their prices first. Requests by bulk users, such as Google, Yahoo & Bing, will be added to the bulk queue and looked up when there are no normal requests. In addition, I can restrict the number of price grabbers which will service the bulk queue.\nThis work has now opened up a new idea I’ve been thinking about – pre-emptively grab the prices of the previous day or week’s most popular titles. The idea would be to add these popular titles to the bulk queue during the quiet time between 03:00 and 06:00. That would mean that when people viewed the title later that day, they’d be fresh.\nI’ve just pushed these changes into the Booko site and with some luck, Google & Co will be happier, Booko users will be happier and I should be able to build new features with this ground work laid. Nice for a Sunday evening’s work.\nIt is funny what you end up working on. Here you are thinking you will be producing great features and then these things come rumbling along at you. Good job getting the monster under control!\nTotally! It’s it quickly went to the top of my list when Booko kept emailing me that it has 100’s of books to grab prices for!\nI like the idea of your site.\nSurely the easiest solution to your problem here is simply adding a robots.txt file telling google not to index /isbn/* ?\nThat would drop this problem immediately.\nThat surely would be the most expedient solution to the problem – however, as much of my traffic is coming from Google, from searches for book titles, I want Google to see the book titles. I could have also prevented a view from Google initiating a price grab, but the bulk queue idea means I could do overnight loads of popular titles."

Read this article to learn why you need a wordpress project management team.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, it might be no news to you that you probably work 60% more than your employees do.\nSince you have more at stake, you might try to have your eyes on every aspect of your business at the same time. Instead of trying to keep an eye on everyone in the office while managing your digital teams or projects, you should consider hiring a WordPress project management team.\nEven if you’re digitally savvy, it takes a lot of time and attention to shift gears from working with a client to working on your WordPress site. During that time, you could be losing efficiency or even losing profits.\nRather than jump from project to project, you should think about hiring a team to manage your WordPress Project. Here are 3 reasons why you should toss the keys to a qualified WordPress project management team.\nThere are lots of milestones your project needs to hit in order to serve your current clients and pick up new ones. To hit that ideal launch date, you’ll need to have someone closely watching over your project.\nHiring a project management team will ensure that will be taken care of so that you can hit your target date while you don’t drop the ball anywhere else. Your developers might forget dates and your marketing team might be troubled by miscommunications while your developers’ attention is on the project.\nCircumvent those issues with hired project managers. Outsourcing your services will allow you to focus on what matters.\nAs you work on a project, you might be in contact with a client who thinks of other important features that their product needs. In an effort to please the client, you and your developers will give the client a resounding “yes”. This can make clients happy until you miss the deadline and disappoint them.\nBy chasing every new feature, you’ll widen the scope of the project and push the release date back further and further.\nYour project managers will try to account for each of these features and schedule them into a calendar of what is doable and what will have to wait. You’ll be able to be straightforward with clients and help them know what to expect by having project managers avoiding scope creep.\nBy adding all those extra features, you’ll be adding extra hours of work and an extended deadline. As projects take longer, clients are less inclined to pay more or buy any extra services.\nHaving a project management team keep an eye on your WordPress project, you’ll be able to make good estimates and keep everyone happy.\nBy managing all of your resources, project managers can save money for a company in the long run. They’ll know what’s doable, what will take too long, and help set expectations for developers and clients.\nIf you’re ready to get project managers on the task of your next WordPress project, contact us to find the right PMs for the job."

However, it does feature an Audi A4 and we get to see it get a very satisfying wash in this new video from the Car Cleaning Guru.\nIn this video, the Guru’s neighbor has a B9-generation Audi A4 as a company car but even though it’s just a company car, it’s far too grimy looking for the Guru’s taste. So he does his neighbor a favor and gives the dirty A4 a proper clean.\nI’m not sure about you but there’s something so satisfying to me about watching these sorts of videos. Watching the process of applying all of the products, letting them soak and seeing the grime simply melt away, then seeing everything get power-washed away and seeing the final clean product is almost therapeutic.\nIt doesn’t hurt that the car in this video is white, which looked really dirty and gross prior to the wash. Afterward, though, it was glistening and looked fantastic. Even just a simple diesel-powered Audi A4 in a pretty basic spec looked like something truly special after its thorough cleaning.\nThe products used are also really impressive and shows how far car-care products have come. Gone are the days when I was a young enthusiast of just getting a bucket of water, some soap and the garden hose. Now, there are so many awesome cleaning products that really melt away grime and make the car truly clean.\nMy only issue with cleaning cars this nicely is that I feel like they shouldn’t be driven afterwards. They look so sparkly clean, I don’t want to think about how dirty they’ll get after one drive in the rain and then all of that hard work is gone. Still, it’s mighty impressive and this video is very satisfying on this Thursday morning."

They don’t like saying ‘no’ to you. They want to make you happy,” he said.\nSota director Bruce Cooper says a mistake that many foreign firms make is to not visit China regularly.\n“I think it’s a big mistake.

Game ends after the Lapras event, Route 50 is not scripted yet.\nI should also inform Town Map crashes the game, so don't use it.\nNew PCs, Indigo and Orange.\nAll OI and Alolan variants added now, huge thanks to Bloodless for a good amount of sprites.\nAlso, Bike is being replaced with a skateboard item, you'll be able to get it as soon as Mikan Island, so walking won't be too bad hopefully until then.\nLooking good man! Great choice of playable characters too.\nIf there's any pokes backsprites you still haven't got for the planned dex let me know in chat and I'll bump em up the list.\nOh yes! Forgot to mention I've disabled all sprite animations. Decided to stick with consistency, this also will give the ROM a bit more space to breath for new sprites.\nEDIT: Hope is now the lab assistant, Faith can reset the time and day of the week (for flash carts), and Charity will now practice battle you as many times as you'd like for some extra cash and experience.\nWhat do you mean by \" also will give the ROM a bit more space to breath for new sprites. \"?\nMore space because less is being used.\nYou plan on adding more demixes into the game? I really liked Tracey's battle theme in the Alpha and more of those would make this game better. Also, the new characters look great especially the male character.\nOnce mmmmm finishes Rangi's requests he's going to be doing some RSE music for me to use in Orange.\nOh ok. That's good. Rangi's near completion of his hack Polished Crystal anyway so yeah.\nMy friend asked me to release something before Beta 1 since he felt the alpha didn't really showcase what this was all about. I agree, so I've decided I'll be posting Alpha 2 once Mikan Island is finished.\nLooks good! I'm curious about those new Kanto islands. But, are there no mountains in the Orange Archipelago?\nI believe Navel and Kinnow have solitary mountains, not sure if anything else does.\nSo, not meaning to nitpick, but the signpost you were using didn't seem to me like it was fitting in as well with the other tiles, so I re-did the sign itself along the lines I figures you were going for. Thoughts Kuroko?\nYours is good too, but the symmetrical wood on either side looks more \"sculpted\" than \"jagged\". How's this?\nAh, I get it now. It was meant to look as if it was like \"driftwood\" they'd turned into a sign. It feels much more relaxed that way, nice improvement!"

        "text": "KENNETT SQUARE, Pa. (WPVI) -- The Chester County district attorney said Friday the report of sewing needles in Halloween candy earlier this week are \"unfounded.\"\nD.A. Tom Hogan said both children involved have now recanted their stories of tainted candy.\nThe first incident was reported at midnight Sunday, after a Kennett Square family reported finding sewing needles in five snack-size Twix candy bars.\nHogan said in that incident an 11-year old girl took several needles from her mother's sewing kit and hid them in the Twix bars.\nShe did it, Hogan said, after she was earlier shown a photograph of needles in a candy bar by an adult who was asking her to be safe while trick-or-treating.\nShe then told the made-up story to her parents, who reported it to police.\nThe second incident involved a 12-year-old boy who made up his story after hearing about the first incident. He put a needle in a Snickers bar and showed it to his sister, Hogan said, who reported it to police.\nHogan said that based on the ages of the children involved, the cooperation of their families, and other mitigating factors, no formal charges will be filed against the children. The children will be dealt with by their parents.\nBoth families apologized for the incident, understanding the serious impact it had on the community, Hogan said.\nAlso this week, investigators in Gloucester Township, New Jersey say a report there of needles in Halloween candy has been determined to be false."

The designers who re-examine, re-evaluate and re-invent our manufactured environment on a daily basis.\nThrough in-depth conversation with the most influential designers in the world, it reminds me of the thing we use every day, that we barely think about, have been designed by someone, with more or less, thought.\nI wouldn’t call myself a designer. I think I prefer to call myself a maker because I usually make things that are not necessarily functional. Regardless of that, the film was very inspiring because I believe that art/craft/design is another form of language, which is a visual tool to communicate with others. Every individual who interacts with an object adds their own interpretation and meaning and it creates a unique connection between a maker, an object and a user. From my perspective, I think memories or emotional links between objects and viewers/users make objects become alive.\nHere is Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer’s a list of 10 essentials for good design.\nGood design should be innovative design.\nGood design should make a product useful."

In time it will develop robust black curved to hooked spines.\nOrigin and Habitat: Cachipampa (Province of Salta).\nDescription: Echinopsis haematantha var. kuehnrichii best known as Lobivia kuehnrichii, is generally included within (as a synonym of) Echinopsis haematantha that is a very variable cactus species showing a large range of natural variability, especially the colour of the flower. The var. kuehnrichii (sometime misspelled \"kuehnrichiana\") distinguishes for its slightly smaller solitary, rarely clustering body with long black hooked spines. The flowers range in colour from red to orange and yellow with usually a white throat circle.\nStem: Globular to oval, with about 12 (or more) ribs.\nCentral spines: 1 to 4, curved to hooked, black to grey.\nFlowers: Red, orange, or yellow with usually a white throat circle (rarely green). Tube olive green. Stigma sometimes green or yellowish white, rarely carmine.\nTaxonomic note: Some authors place Echinopsis haematantha var. kuehnrichii as a synonim of Echinopsis chrysantha.\nCultivation and Propagation: It is a summer-growing species that offers no cultivation difficulty. Water regularly in summer (but do not over-water). It needs good drainage and very porous soil. Keep rather dry in winter. Feed with a high potassium fertilizer in summer. It is quite frost resistant if kept dry (hardy to -5° C). Outside full sun or afternoon shade, inside it needs bright light, and some direct sun."

        "text": "I’m sitting in an airport in Rio Brazil. It’s 5:18am. I’ve just finished my favorite typical Brazilian food, pão de queijo and I’m working my way through an overly heated espresso. On my way here while standing in a security line I entertained myself by reading all of the inspirational quotes scattered through my passport. The obvious American phrases like “We hold these truths to be self-evident…” are in there, but the very last one confirmed what I’m about to write.\nIt’s a known fact that I’m a notorious business book nerd. I couldn’t sooner choose a favorite one than pick my favorite star in the sky. But if I were to pick a book that spoke not only to my business but to my personal life as well, it would be Tim Ferris’ 4 Hour Workweek.\nIf you’ve never read this book I highly recommend it for everyone, business owner of not. If for nothing else other than some quick tips on streamlining your life so you’re not wasting it away doing tedious and methodical tasks, it’s worth the read. The premise, however, is about learning to create a business that runs itself so that you can spend your time living life and taking “mini-retirements” rather than working your whole life to enjoy a few free years at the end of it, bored out of your mind and not able to enjoy it like you would have had you done it in your earlier years.\nIt’s a crazy concept and I think Ferris takes it to an extreme that I’m not quite willing to go because, well, I actually like to work. My work, though stressful and overwhelming at times, is part of my life and not something I wish myself through day-to-day. For those of you that don’t know, I’m not only a wedding photographer, but I’m also an educator and travel around the world speaking at major industry conventions and teaching other photographers and small business owners marketing tips and workflow management among other things. It's fun and truth be told I have a secret love for all things cultural, especially learning other languages.\nFerris’ idea behind mini-retirements, which are typically 3-6 months long, is that you don’t just take an extended vacation, but you choose somewhere in the world to go and work remotely while concentrating on learning something new intellectually and physically. You have the time to really dedicate to your new conquests because you’re not stuck behind a computer all day and you’re bettering yourself as a person and getting to enjoy life outside of the office.\nWell, after years of preparation I’m going to do this. I’m taking my first mini-retirement. It’s a bit different from what I described above but the premise is the same. My family and I are spending six weeks in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil where I’ll work remotely, get to appear on PhotosTV (in English and Portuguese!) connect (and hopefully mentor) Brazilian photographers and learn to speak Portuguese (I’ve already started!). Holy crap, I’m doing it.\nMy hope is that I’ll be able to learn a new language and culture that’ll kick my creativity and passion into overdrive. This will be a test mini-retirement that will ideally lead to a yearly one, maybe 8 weeks next time and 10 the time after, in all different parts of the world. My dream is to raise my daughter (and any others to follow!) to share the same love I have for languages, cultures and people while learning that life doesn’t have to be confined to a 9-5 cubicle.\nThe best part about this is that it doesn’t change my photography business at all since the majority of times I meet with clients is via Skype, and I rarely photograph weddings or engagements during the winter months. In fact, I think this adds to my business as I’ll have a truly unique perspective on capturing life and a vastly cultured creative passion behind it that can’t be matched. Not to mention getting to know so many people around the world will undoubtedly lead to opportunities to photograph destination weddings worldwide. To top it off, thanks to my Brazilian friend Paula, who has a business called Wellcome that gives a personalized service to help travelers get used to a new country and immerse themselves in the culture based on their lifestyle (email her at localwellcome@gmail.com to hear more!), I have a good idea of all the places around where I’m staying and I know that I’m going to adapt rapidly to the culture.\nWhy am I sharing this with you? Well, because I want to for one. I want to hear the support behind my decision to keep me motivated and I want to hear the negative reactions to it so I know what odds to aim to beat. Most of all, I want to inspire. Inspire you beyond your box, even if that box isn’t a cubicle. Maybe your box is in the shape of fear, or lack of faith or one of a million excuses for not working towards your big goals. I believe when you’re not setting life goals, you’re setting yourself up to run in circles chasing the wind. If nothing else, I hope this inspires at least one person to dream a big dream and find a way to work towards it.\nHere’s to looking out from a higher plateau.\nEstou sentada em um aeroporto no Rio de Janeiro. São 5:18 da manhã. Terminei de comer o típico \"pão de queijo\" brasileiro, meu favorito, e estou bebericando um expresso mais do que quente. No meu caminho para cá, na fila da segurança, eu me distraía lendo todas aquelas frases inspiradoras espalhadas pelo meu passaporte. A óbvia frase americana \"We hold these truths to be self-evident…\" (Consideramos estas verdades como evidentes por si mesmas...) está lá, mas a última é a que confirma o que estou prestes a escrever.\nÉ um fato que eu sou uma notória nerd em se tratanto de livros de negócios. Eu poderia escolher um livro preferido antes mesmo de escolher uma estrela preferida no céu. Mas se eu fosse escolher um livro que não falasse apenas sobre negócios, mas também da minha vida pessoal, esse livro seria o 4 Hour Workweek (Trabalhe 4 Horas Por Semana) do Tim Ferris\"\nSe você nunca leu esse livro, eu o recomendo para todos vocês, donos do próprio negócio ou não. Mesmo que seja apenas para encontrar dicas rápidas para a padronizar processos em sua vida de forma que você não desperdice tempo com tarefas entediantes e metódicas, vale a pena ler. A premissa é aprender a criar um negócio que funciona por si só, para que assim você possa utilizar o seu tempo aproveitando a vida e “mini-aposentadorias” em vez de trabalhar a sua vida inteira para apreciar somente alguns poucos anos no final das contas, extremamente entediado e não podendo aproveitar o tempo como você aproveitava na juventude.\nÉ um conceito muito louco e eu acho que Ferris o leva ao extremo, coisa que não estou disposta a fazer, porque eu realmente gosto de trabalhar. O meu trabalho, mesmo muito pesado e estressante às vezes, é parte da minha vida mas não algo que eu desejo para mim no dia-a-dia. Para aqueles que não sabem, eu não sou apenas uma fotógrafa de casamento, mas também uma educadora, e viajo ao redor do mundo ministrando palestras em grandes congressos e ensinando marketing e gerenciamento de fluxo de trabalho a outros fotógrafos e pequenos empreendedores , além de outros assuntos. É divertido, na verdade eu tenho um amor secreto por tudo que é cultural, especialmente outros idiomas.\nA ideia de Ferris sobre mini-aposentadorias, que basicamente são de 3 à 6 meses, não é somente tirarmos longas férias, mas escolher um lugar no mundo para ir e trabalhar remotamente enquanto se concentra em aprender algo novo intelectualmente e fisicamente. Você tem o tempo para realmente se dedicar a novas conquistas porque você não está preso a um computador o dia todo e está tentando se tornar uma pessoa melhor ao apreciar a vida fora do escritório.\nEntão, o que isso tem a ver comigo?\nBom, depois de anos de preparação, eu vou fazer isso. Eu vou curtir a minha primeira mini-aposentadoria. É um pouco diferente do que eu descrevi anteriormente, mas a premissa é a mesma. Minha família e eu vamos passar 6 semanas em Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, onde eu vou trabalhar remotamente, aparecer na PhotosTV (em português e inglês), ministrar um workshop pela Editora Photos na belíssima Balneário Camboriú e aprender português (eu já comecei!). Caramba, eu estou fazendo isso.\nMinha esperança é que eu seja capaz de aprender uma nova cultura e um idioma que elevar a minha criatividade e minha paixão. Esse vai ser um teste para a minha mini-aposentadoria que poderá ser anual, talvez 8 semanas na próxima vez e 10 na próxima, em todas as partes do mundo. Meu sonho é criar a minha filha (e todas as outras que vierem) para compartilhar o mesmo amor que eu tenho por idiomas, culturas e povos, enquanto aprende que não precisa estar confinada a um escritório .\nA melhor parte é que não isso não afeta o meu negócio de fotografia de maneira alguma, mesmo porque, na maioria das vezes, eu me encontro com clientes via Skype, e eu raramente fotografo casamentos ou noivos durante os meses de inverno. Na verdade, eu acho que isso agrega valor ao meu negócio, já que eu vou ter uma perspectiva única para capturar a vida e uma incomparável paixão amplamente influenciada pela cultura. Sem mencionar o fato de que conhecer tantas pessoas ao redor do mundo irá, sem dúvida, levar a oportunidades de fotografar casamentos por todo o mundo.\nPor que eu estou compartilhando isso com você? Bom, porque eu quero. Eu quero receber o apoio pela minha decisão para me manter motivada e eu quero ouvir as críticas para saber os problemas que eu preciso enfrentar. Acima de tudo, eu quero inspirar. Inspirar você para além dos seu limite, mesmo que esse limite não seja um escritório. Talvez você esteja limitado pelo medo, ou pela falta de fé ou por um milhão de desculpas para não se esforçar e alcançar seus grandes objetivos. Eu acredito que quando você não cria metas para a vida, você acaba correndo em círculos contra o vento. Além do mais, espero inspirar pelo menos uma pessoa a sonhar grande e encontrar uma maneira correr atrás desse sonho.\nA um olhar de um patamar mais elevado.\nTamara Lackey's reDefine Show Interview!"

        "text": "Initially formed to assist in the defence of the city of Metz against French bombing raids, Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 17 would go on to become one of the most distinguish German fighter units of World War 1. Its first victory was scored by the pilot whose story is inextricably interwoven with that of his unit - the ‘Blue Max' recipient Julius Buckler. He was largely responsible for inspiring the unit's unique Esprit de Corps, expressed in its famous and unique ‘battle-cry' of ‘Malaula!' Indeed, in its final days the unit gained the nickname Zirkus Buckler, or the ‘Buckler Circus'. Besides Buckler, Jasta 17 boasted such aces as Karl Strasser, Alfred Fleischer and Christian Donhauser. In addition, the roster included colourful characters like the successful Jewish airman Jakob Wolff, who at over 48 years of age was the oldest German fighter pilot of the war. The story of this illustrious unit is told with many first-hand accounts by Buckler, Fleischer and others, as well as dozens of rare archival photos of the unit's beautifully decorated fighter aircraft.\nGreg VanWyngarden has had a lifelong interest in World War 1 aviation and has been particularly active in researching the colours and markings of German fighter aircraft. He has written many books for Osprey and has co-authored three previous titles with Norman Franks: Fokker Dr I Aces of World War 1 and Fokker D VII Aces of World War 1, Volume 1 and Volume 2. He was the sole author of: Aviation Elite Units 16 ‘Richthofen's Circus', Elite Units 19 Jagdgeschwader Nr II Geschwader ‘Berthold', Elite Units 26 Jagdstaffel 2 ‘Boelcke' - Richthofen's Mentor, Elite Units 40 Jasta 18 The Red Noses, Pfalz Scout Aces of World War 1, Early German Aces of World War 1, and Albatros Aces of World War I, Part 2.Harry Dempsey has been passionate about World War 1 aviation for over 30 years, having produced some of the most technically accurate colour artwork on the subject.

In this test all about condition of esophagus, stomach, and upper intestine or duodenum of patients exposes clearly in the reports. After seeing this report, Our Gastroenterologist give their proper treatment for specific disease and their patients get cure soon, after completing full course of Our Doctors which they have suggested.\nUpper GI endoscopy testing is a unique procedure to identify many different diseases: Such as – Ulcers, Cancer, Celiac Disease, Blockages, Barrett’s Esophagus, Strictures of Esophagus and Gastritis etc.\nThe Upper G. I. Endoscopy procedure uses an endoscope to examine the interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body. Unlike many other medical imaging techniques, endoscopes are inserted directly into the organ.There are many types of endoscopes and they are used depending on the site in the body and type of procedure, an endoscopy may be performed either by a Gastroenterologist or a Surgeon. A patient may be fully conscious or anaesthetized during the procedure since doctor uses an endoscope (flexible tube with a camera), to see the lining of upper GI tract. Most often the term Upper G. I. Endoscopy is used to refer to an examination of the Upper Part of the Gastrointestinal Tract, known as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\nAfter an upper GI endoscopy, We suggest our patient to stay at the hospital or outpatient center for 1 to 2 hours after go through this procedure till the effect of given sedative ended, We also suggest our patient to rest at home for the whole of the day, to care sore throat for 1 to 2 days and to go back to his normal diet once his swallowing returns to normal. If our any patient facing any type of problem in the above activities, he can come to us and can meet his concerned doctor without any delay with free of cost.\nThe Upper GI Endoscopes is generally assumed as it is a safe procedure. There are no any chance of complications from this procedure, but sometimes it starts bleeding from the area where the doctor took the tissue samples. Sometimes in some cases patients feel abnormal situation when they are given sedative, like breathing and heart problems. These are the some normal conditions faced by the patients after passing through this procedure but these conditions are generally gone away within some days."

Unlike ducks, coots bring their food to the surface before eating it; this results in frequent cases of food stealing (4). They are opportunistic birds, and may feed in grasslands at certain times of the year (6). During winter, large flocks may gather on large lakes and reservoirs (10), these gatherings are relatively peaceful compared to the fierce territorial aggression seen during the breeding season (2). The nest, a mound of dead reeds, is usually built amongst emergent vegetation (6). From mid-March, between 6 and 9 speckled eggs are laid (occasionally up to 15 eggs, though these large clutches may be laid by more than one female (10)). The eggs are incubated by both parents for up to 24 days (6). The chicks leave the nest a few days after hatching, and reach independence at around 8 weeks of age (6). Two broods are produced a year, but occasionally a third brood may occur (6).\nSeen from the train between Airport and center.\nswampy areas near railway station.

        "text": "On a very hot Friday, 7 February, 1969, just after 7.00am, the Southern Aurora, Australia’s overnight express passenger train between Sydney and Melbourne, collided head-on with an Albury-bound goods train, 174km north of Melbourne. The Melbourne-bound Southern Aurora ran through the Violet Town crossing loop where it should have waited for the goods train to pass.\nThe Southern Aurora bore the brunt of the collision because the goods train was heavier. Nine people were killed (2 drivers, 1 electrician, 1 conductor and 5 passengers) and 117 passengers were injured. Most deaths and casualties occurring in cars 7 and 8. The two locomotives (S314 and S316) and five carriages were written off. The first two sleeping carriages of the express were crushed, a third sleeping carriage and a lounge car were thrown from the track and landed on top of locomotive S316. The fireman on the goods train jumped out of the locomotive cab prior to the collision whilst the driver went back into the engine room of the locomotive. He did not survive the impact of the head-on collision.\nTrack damage stretched over a distance of 200 yards and involved the restoration of 450 yards of rail, 270 sleepers and 300 cubic yards of ballast.\nThe coroner, HW Pascoe, found that John Bowden, the driver of the Aurora, died from heart failure before the crash. Bowden knew that he had a pre-existing heart condition and was advised by his doctor that he could die at any time and that he should retire. When asked what would happen if he died suddenly at the controls, Bowden said that there would be another crew member who was qualified to stop the train in an emergency. As it happened, there were two other crew members qualified to perform the task, fireman Mervyn George Coulthard and the guard at the rear of the train William Frederick Wyer, but both failed to act.\nCoulthard was preoccupied making a cup of tea and Wyer admitted to ‘dozing from time to time’. Consequently, Wyer’s entries in the guard’s journal were falsified and deemed by Pascoe to be ‘largely a piece of fiction’.\nThe coroner, Pascoe found that Coulthard and Wyer breached their duty in relation to public safety and that the tragedy could have been prevented if they had been alert or awake. He declared both men ‘extremely negligent’, but stopped short of declaring them culpable. He decided that the resulting deaths of the accident were caused by ‘misadventure’.\nIt was determined there was no mechanical failure on board the Southern Aurora and that all appropriate maintenance had been carried out. There was no criticism of the crew on the goods train as when the imminent collision became apparent, they could do nothing to avoid the accident.\nThe recommendations put forth by Pascoe included annual medical tests for drivers with an electro-cardiogram every two years, installation of a vigilance control button to be pressed regularly to prevent guards from sleeping whilst on duty, the fitting of speedometers to guards’ vans to warn them if the train is speeding and potentially not in control of the driver, and the adoption of a modified vigilance control in locomotives on passenger trains with the driver and fireman confirming regularly that they are alert to their duties.\nThe Library has 50 digitised photographs of the Southern Aurora train crash in its collection.\n1.

Russell worked for Victorian Railways for 35 years.\nThis disaster forms the background to the novel by Steven Carroll “The Art of the engine driver” (first published in 2001). Chapters 41, 43 and 48 deal directly with the disaster and its aftermath although the novel refers to the disaster as involving the Spirit of Progress rather than the Southern Aurora as was actually the case and the names of the crew in the passenger train are altered.\nWow Mick! The third sleeping carriage was thrown from the track and landed on one of the locomotives. It would have been a traumatic ordeal for all involved. Thank you for sharing your personal connection with the event.\nReading all the above and seeing the photos brings back vivid memories.That day is engraved in my memory forever, I was the fireman on the goods train and 0710 hrs 7 Feb 1969 is like a birthday to me, I survived, where too many did not.\nI can imagine revisiting the events of that fateful day would open the floodgates. The survival instinct is a strong force. I’m glad you managed to jump from the train when you did. The disaster resulted in a tragic loss of life that could have been prevented. Thank you for sharing your part in the story.\nHello Fred, it was a terrible day. I lived 12 km away and for me etched in my memory is the awful sound of the crash. 4 members of my immediate family were involved in fire fighting, rescue and other important activities. The local Violet Town community is planning a remembrance weekend on the 50th anniversary in Feb 2019. Depending on funding we hope to create a range of respectful tributes to the volunteers, organisations, victims and survivors of the tragedy.\nI am a West Australian survivor of the Southern Aurora crash if you would like any input regarding my experience of that horrible day.\nHi Judi, I only just saw your reply here. Thanks for your message. Sorry I hadn’t replied earlier. It would be great to speak with you!\nI visited the site today and felt quite moved being there. I was 12 at the time of accident and remember it well. I had traveled on the Spirit of Progress with my parents a couple of years before and was impressed with seeing the Aurora depart ahead of us.\nIn 1987 my wife and I traveled on the Aurora with our then baby daughter. I can only imagine the horror of that fateful morning at Violet Town.\n1982 that should have read.\nThank you for sharing your connection to the event. It was indeed a fateful morning on that hot summer’s day in February 1969.\nThe Violet Town community hopes to greatly improve the small tribute at the crash site with landscaping and information, but also to create a meditation garden next to the railway line in town, across the tracks from the station.\nI’m glad your grandparents lived to tell the tale. They were up with their technology. Super 8 cameras were relatively new at that time. The first one was manufactured in 1965.\nThat’s amazing Dean that they had footage. I have seen a lot of photos, but would like to see that footage some day. It would be great to have that as part of the history I am putting together. Cheers. Bruce.\nMy grandmother’s brother Fred McKenzie was the conductor that was killed.\nThis is the first time I’ve seen pictures of the accident. I can’t believe anyone survived!\nThank you for taking the time to comment. The images of twisted metal are confronting. It looks like a bomb blast.\nIt was a very tragic day with loss of life, and many injured. Thanks to the efforts of many people, there were not more losses.\nHi Debra. The Violet Town community is trying to find the families of all who died that day, so we can make contact and ensure the family can attend our commemoration next February.\nfor details. This is just a new website we have launched.\nYour grandmothers brother (Fred McKenzie) family is one I have not been able to locate to invite to the Southern Aurora commemoration at Violet Town in February 7-10 2019.\nWould you be able to contact me please so I can send an invitation?\nThey were somewhat primitive by today’s standards as you could put a toolbox on them and continue running unlike the push button ones they have now, at least the American versions had these pedals. Numerous accidents in the USA were caused by crews sleeping and I always wondered if the Southern Aurora’s second engineer was really making tea in the rear of the locomotive as reported at the time..\nThanks for taking the time to comment Malcolm. Even modern ‘dead man’s pedals’ aren’t fool proof. In the 2003 Waterfall rail accident, the pedal failed to activate and 7 people including the driver were killed. We will never know for sure if Coulthard was distracted making a cup of tea, but we do know that if he and Wyer were alert and/or awake, the outcome could have been very different.\nThanks for your comment. The driver of the Aurora was advised by his doctor to retire to avoid an incident such as this. He chose to continue driving in the knowledge that he was putting the lives of others at risk. He bares responsibility for the fatal consequences of that choice.\nHi Sarah, would you know where I can find a list of the dead and injured from the crash? No websites pertaining to the disaster appear to have a list. I would appreciate this information to assist in a contribution to a segment of my partner’s 50 year school reunion later this year, in which memories are to be shared of experiences had since the students left school all those years ago, which have impacted their lives. My partner (as a 19 year old ) witnessed the immediate aftermath of this horrific accident unfold with a friend, as they were driving alongside the railway, and rushed to the scene, being the first to arrive at the site, at the same time as a unit of the local rural fire brigade. By co-incidence, one of the female victims was from the suburb in Brisbane in which he grew up, and it is her name we are keen to confirm.\nThanks for your question. I’ll get back to you through your email.\nHi Carmel. That’s amazing your partner arrived first on the scene, it would have been shocking. My 20 year old brother and 18 year old brother were both there too, with our father and very involved. I think they got there about 1/2 an hour after the crash. I was 15 and my father dropped me off at the bus stop to go to school, and the smoke was going up like a ribbon thousands of feet into the sky. It was spooky.\nDo you think I could speak to your partner about this as part of my recording the history?\nThe list of dead and injured is in the official report into the accident that we hold here at the Library.\nRailway accident : report on the collision that occurred between the Sydney to Melbourne express passenger train, the Southern Aurora and a Melbourne to Albury goods train, near Violet Town on 7th February, 1969 ([Melbourne] : [Victorian Railways Commissioner’s Office], ).\nI’ll send you the names of the mother and daughter from Doveton in a separate email.\nThe second young daughter was badly injured, and was the last person rescued. It was a terrible situation for her of course. She was rescued by a team which included my father and brother. Indeed, she very clearly remembers someone calling “Bill, Bill” (my fathers name) saying that he had heard a voice calling for help from the bottom of the wreckage. As a result she worked out who Bill probably was and then found my name in the phone book. It has been lovely to make the connection to our family. And it was coincidental that I was already compiling a local history of the tragedy. Cheers. Bruce. See contact details in another post above.\nHello K Williamson,that was my mother Nora Newell and my sister Lorna,tragically both were killed and l survived.\nHello there. Heather I was the young girl that visited you in the Wangaratta base hospital. Julie Bowdern. I would love to catch up. Every Week end I went up and stayed with you.\nI served on the the Ballarat – Mildura line from 1974 to 1989. Stations i worked at, Maryborough, Dunolly, Cope Cope, Donald, Bealiba, Birchip, Bet Bet, Emu, Bacchus Marsh, Parwan, among others.\nMy highest rank was Acting ASM at Watchem in the 1980s.\nThanks for reading the blog Ian and sharing your connection to regional railways in Victoria.\nI know Merve personaly have done for quite some years, very caring man he is now in an aged care facility and has been for 3 years. He has never discussed the accident to anyone so this was a big shock when I came across the article. It now haunts him deeply along with his dementia, very sad.\nIf you know Merve and family etc, are you able to make contact and see if he/they would like to attend the 50th anniversary commemoration at Violet Town Feb 7-10 2019.\nI just hope that Heather makes contact with me. I have searched tiredlessly to find her.\nHi Julie. I am often in contact with Heather. She was found by my father and his mate in the wreckage and I speak to her regularly. It has been nice in recent years to establish a connection to her with me and family.\nHi Julie, this is heather here,l am not sure who you are?Were you in tractor accident on your parents place.?\nI am a nurse that looked after you in the Wangaratta Base hospital after the accident. I often wonder how you are and how you got on after your time with us.\nWe ( the nurses )would read stories to you when we had time and try to entertain you as you were often very bored. It was very difficult for a little girl to be tied to a bed, waiting for your leg to heal.\nWhile you were a patient you wrote a letter to your local paper to thank all the people who had helped you, you drew a picture of me next to your bed. We still have a copy of it.\nHi Heather. That is a great connection! I was contacted recently by another nurse who looked after Heather. She lives in Benalla. Her father also was involved in the aftermath, as were so many local people.\nI emailed the names to you a year ago. I’ve just forwarded it to you again.\nHi Colleen, many thanks, we are progressing gradually with the project, and still seeking more funds to help us, but its going well.\nToday a friend of Allan Hyatt from Ballarat dropped in to the local cafe. Unfortunately they didnt catch a name. Look forward to meeting you in February.\nHi Julie sorry for very late reply,were you in wheelchair,please send me your email,mine is hevs2@bigpond.com,Cheers Heather.\nMy father (Charles C. Clayton) was at the time the Assistant Chief Signal and Telegraph Engineer and, as you might imagine, the accident played a big part in our lives. He was summoned to determine if a signalling fault caused the accident (it didn’t) and I distinctly remember the point blades that the Aurora ran through at speed were on his office floor for several months. They had a deep gash there the S class wheels struck them. Apparently his department had recommended vigilance controls (known as “dead man’s brake”) be fitted to all mainline locomotives for several years prior to the 1967 Broadford goods crash but the Commisioners considered it too expensive. Of course, after the Aurora crash….\nDad retired in October 1970 and passed away in October 1982.\nThanks for sharing your connection to the event Fraser. Tragically it is too often the case that safety measures aren’t put in place until serious injury or fatalities occur. It must have been very frustrating for your father.\nHi Fraser, great to see your comment here, I hadn’t noticed it before. It was also great to catch up with you in February. Will catch you next time you are passing through and have a coffee!\nI quite by accident came across a news article about the 50th anniversary on the Friday night of the weekend of the anniversary. My mother Joan Mullins & I were survivors of the Southern Aurora train accident. My mother has since deceased.\nAfter some phone calls & organising I was able to drive to Violet Town from the Sth Highlands NSW to attend the commemoration of the garden on the Sunday. I met committee members Gary & Bruce & other Violet Town folk who were so welcoming & grateful I made the trip at short notice. So am I. And it was so nice to meet the lovely lady & her daughter who cared for some of us at her home after the accident. And to meet Nurse Heather, and a niece of one of the passengers who sadly died was special. And the thoughtful people I met & chatted with, thank you.\nThe exhibition Bruce Cummings has created is no mean feat & added to the memories I have in a scrapbook of the accident.\nTo visit the site of the accident after all these years, I still cannot describe how I felt. I have memories of the accident but memories of it actually happening are quite vivid. We were fortunate, my mother & I to be in the first passenger carriage after the dining car to remain on the line. We were not too seriously injured, though I do remember the pain my mother was in with her neck when we were travelling back to Adelaide that night on the Overlander train from Melbourne. Despite the pain she was in, my mother feared if we didn’t get the train home that night, she would never be able to get on another train.\nI am forever grateful for the tireless work the committee has done & is doing to create such a meaningful & moving memorial which will bring calm & peace to many. It is a tragic event that will not be forgotten.\nThanks for getting in touch and sharing your personal experience of the accident. So glad you were able to make it to the commemoration.\nNo worries Bruce. I’m glad the blog has provided a platform for people to connect with others and share their experiences related to the event.\nhi Brenda, it was great to meet up with you at the exhibition and chat for a while. I am so glad that you found out about the commemoration events and you were able to come down at short notice. It was a very meaningful weekend for all involved in any way.\nI was constantly asked by visitors to the exhibition what the plans were next for the exhibition, and they all wanted it to continue in some way.\nAs a result I kept it open in the big hall for another 10 days when we needed to move it out for another function.\nI have moved most of the exhibition into adjacent rooms in the Violet Town town hall complex, but it isn’t quite as spacious, however it is working well with constant visitors. The plan is to keep the exhibition there for the rest of the year. When we can seal and restore the Aurora carriage to a display space we hope to move the whole exhibition into the carriage. We are still chasing funding support for that work, and we are increasing our band of volunteers, so the important work goes on.\nlook forward to another chat as part of my compiling the peoples history."

        "text": "No need to rely on just grenades and timed explosives if you've got this smelly little beauty.\nThe stink bomb has been the odd man out in Fortnite's list of portable explosives. Many see the regular grenades, clingers, and timed explosives as far more effective ways to blow away the competition. But have no doubt, the stink bomb can be incredibly useful in short range, mid range, and long range scenarios throughout a match with its deadly assault on the senses. With the aid of our Fortnite stink bomb guide it'll be a difficult item to pass up, even if it doesn't smell great.\nThe smelly explosive is a common pickup that can be found in chests or out in the open: it’s a blue bottle with a green substance in it. It has a similar throw range to other hand held items, it has a small area of effect after exploding, and it deals five damage per half second for nine total seconds. That adds up to a total of 90 damage if the opponents takes the brunt of the attack, just shy of knocking out a full health bar.\nThere are a number of strategies that the stink bomb can support, even more so than some of the other explosives since its effects linger longer than the typical grenade.\nIt’s a common to get locked into a mid to long range firefight with little chance to reposition, pinned down by an opponent with the higher ground. Any step outside cover will lead to a face full of bullets.\nThe gas cloud that stink bombs create can offer a bit of respite from the eyes of the enemy. Each bomb emits a small cloud of green gas that can be used to make maneuvers between different types of cover. A combination of three bombs, the amount each pickup comes with, can allow you to easy move out of you opponent's line of site and help you flank them.\nBuilding is key in Fortnite. One dominant strategy for gunfights is to build higher than your opponent, and sometimes that mentality comes before the fight even starts with people building towers inside the circle and waiting.\nStink bombs are a great counter to this strategy. Their gas permeates through walls and the cloud is big enough to fill the the entirety of one space inside the structure. It can either trap the enemy in one part of the structure, force them to abandon their home, or hit them directly and cause a good bit of damage. This strategy also works well in areas of the map that have built-in chokepoints like Dusty Depot. Stink bombs can be perfect for scenarios when you catch other players hiding in the back of trucks, in storage units, or in any long hallway.\nThe stink bomb has a lot of range. It can be thrown surprisingly far in the middle of a gunfight. You can use it to force enemies out of hiding, and even push them towards you if you throw the stink bomb on the opposite side of whoever you're fighting with.\nIt's a great way to force opposing players out of cover, which is especially effective when they have a considerable fort build up.\nWhether or not you’re actually able to hit an enemy with the gas cloud, it makes a lot of noise. Using it will definitely draw some attention if you need to relocate or try to flank an enemy. You have three to use so they can get thrown in different directions to disorient the enemy, moving their eyes elsewhere.\nThis is especially effective in areas with tight spaces like Tilted Towers, the viking settlement, and Lucky Landing."

        "text": "First off, great game. Highly addicting! I'm looking forward to the update!\nI have a few suggestions. The first is the most major, and the couple after that are probably minor fixes. Basically, the problem I'm having is that when it comes time to replace my fleet with new planes, there's nothing \"new\" to replace them with. It would be cool to see some type of fleet renewal program, but impossible to \"invent\" new Boeing and Airbus planes, and cheesy to make fake designs for the year 2035 or so and beyond.\nWhich is when it hit me--why not allow users to go back and start the game in 1965-1970 if they want, then add in aircraft from that time period. DC-8s, DC-9s, 707s, 720s, 727s, 737-200s, Caravelles, etc., then move forward through time to where the DC-10, 747 and L-1011 become available, then the MD-80 and 737-300/500 series, and on up into the airliners available in-game currently. You could also put a \"used aircraft market\" in-game, where players can get older airliners on the cheap, but they have shorter service lives and require more spending on maintenance (i.e., a new aircraft has a 30-year life in-game, but depending upon the age of the used aircraft being purchased, it may have a life of only 10 years). You could also, for the sake of realism, set it up so that airliners are only available to be purchased new up until a couple of years after their production in real life ended, but those designs would be available for a used-plane purchase for 20-30 years after production ends.\nIt doesn't exactly solve the problem of what to do once you're to the year 2030, and you have to replace your massive 737-800 fleet with, well, more 737-800s, but it would do wonders for replay value if players started out in the 1960s or '70s, and could build their fleets around different types of aircraft every time.\nThe other suggestions are, like I said, fairly minor compared to that. It would be cool if we had some kind of drop-down route menu, instead of having to scroll through all of our routes to get to one of them or select the two cities. Also, I'd love to see fuel consumption, maintenance costs and crew numbers for aircraft so that we have the added variable of (for example) the A320 being less-expensive than the 737-800, but the 737-800 having lower fuel consumption and maintenance costs. And, as has been mentioned before, bulk discounts for aircraft purchases would be very cool.\nLike I said, though, it is a great game already, but a historical mode of play would just be beyond amazing!\nThat's an awesome idea. That would be great, another idea that would be awesome is another game mode. I was thinking of something where you start off with an airline that has been in business for some time and is in trouble or not doing so well, or just small, then your goal is to make it the number one airline. Example would be, you start the game and now you're the new CEO of ABC Airlines. ABC Airlines has a couple of hubs, but is not doing so well. They are number 2 or last in the world and your job is to make them number one."

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Sunday warned Congress against manufacturing a crisis over federal spending in the months ahead, as looming deadlines set the stage for a repeat of the political deadlock which two years ago triggered worldwide financial market turmoil.\n“We have already done a lot of deficit reduction,” he said in an interview on NBC. Lew spoke on four TV talk shows, setting out Obama’s priorities ahead of an expected showdown this fall.\nBy early November, Congress must raise the legal limit on the country’s borrowing authority or risk an unprecedented default on the government’s debt.\n“We need to get the debt limit extended in a way that doesn’t create a crisis,” Lew said.\nLew, who was Obama’s budget director in 2011, reiterated the president’s stance that he would not consider short-term spending cuts, nor would he offset defense spending cuts with reductions in other government programs.\n“The president has made crystal clear, he’s not going to negotiate over the debt limit,” Lew said in an interview on ABC.\nRepublicans have eyed this budget deadline as a way to roll back steep spending cuts for defense programs. But that is not an option, Lew said.\nAsked about the possibility of a federal response to Detroit’s recent bankruptcy declaration, Lew threw cold water on any chances the struggling city will get federal aid.\n“Detroit is going to have to work with its creditors on this,” Lew told ABC."

        "text": "The iPad has always been a paradox. While it may have been built to fill the rather sizable gap between the iPhone and Mac, it never really embraced its own identity, playing second fiddle to each of the devices it was stuck between. Consequently, Apple's mighty tablet has never quite been able to live up to the lofty expectations it created as the de facto leader of the post-PC revolution.\nBut all that's about to change. During the middle of his WWDC presentation, Craig Federighi somewhat surprisingly devoted an entire segment to the iPad, highlighting several exclusive features that power users have been clamoring for. For the first time since its launch, Apple seems to want the iPad to be a device that will truly transform the way we work. With iOS 9, Apple has refocused its attention on what the iPad is and can be, positioning it as a powerful, versatile tool that seeks to redefine the role the Mac plays in Apple's ecosystem.\nThe biggest difference between iOS and OS X has always been multitasking. Even more than how they handle files and apps, Macs run circles around iPads when it comes to doing more than one thing at once, deftly letting us surf the web while writing, or watch a video while clearing out our inboxes. iOS 9 doesn't quite bring desktop-level multitasking to our iPads, at least not yet, but Apple has finally devised a way to let us run two apps simultaneously. And in true Cupertino fashion, it's an elegant, sophisticated solution.\nThe most obvious implementation for tablet multitasking---and one that has is already utilized on the Samsung Galaxy Tab---has always been to simply split the screen down the center to allow two apps to run side by side. And while Apple did adopt what it's calling Split View for the iPad Air 2, it also understood that the method isn't ideal for all uses. In fact, it's probably the aspect of multitasking most people are likely to use the least. More often than not I'm not specifically looking to run two apps together; rather I just want to grab a quick piece of information from an email or quickly look up something on the web, and I don't need to keep the second app visible for very long.\nThat's where Slide Over comes in. Like the Notification Center on OS X, it can be activated by swiping from from the right side of the screen, bringing up a skinny version of an app operating in its own window. It's a perfect way to respond to a message or quickly copy a bit of text into a note without needing to divert too much attention away from the main app you're working in.\nBut the most exciting piece of the iPad's new multitasking options is Picture In Picture. If you're watching a video or making a FaceTime call, you can shrink it and move it around just as you would a QuickTime window on your Mac---except it's smart enough to resize itself and always stays as the topmost window so it won't get lost under another app. It's the first feature to break free from the full-screen mold, and it has the potential to fundamentally change iOS almost as much as Siri has.\nHad I not seen it on the WWDC stage, the iPad's multitasking optionsmost notably Picture in Picturewould seem like someone's fantastical iOS concept video, a brilliant idea that just wouldn't be possible in reality. But much like the Siri demo opened our eyes to how voice control could eventually take over navigation and dictation, it's not hard to imagine a future incarnation where a notepad or calculator could offer the same floating functionality, elevating the iPad to new heights of productivity.\nIt's the closest thing to desktop multitasking that I've seen on a tablet and it portends as bright a future for the iPad as it's ever had. If the generations-old A7 chip can already handle playing continuous video while jumping in and out of apps, future generations will be able to handle a far greater load, bringing us ever closer to the day where we can choose between full-screen and floating apps, just like on our Macs.\nAnd once that happens, we won't need a hybrid machine like the Surface; the iPad will be powerful and capable enough to handle all of our day-to-day computing needs, reserving our Macs for more processor intensive tasks like Photoshop or Final Cut.\nThe keyboard is one of the greatest multitasking tools we have on our Macs, letting us switch apps and find hidden documents with just a few strokes. But even with iOS 8's QuickType and third-party keyboards, the iPad keyboard isn't an asset to productivity. Keyboards like Fleksy and Swype that are built to input text faster with one finger aren't helpful on the larger screen, and with the exception of some clever in-app implementations, I haven't found any that are helpful when navigating or selecting text.\nIt's an area where the multitouch can offer an advantage. Efficiency on our MacBooks is about doing as much as we can without lifting our hands off of the keyboard, and Apple is finally bringing that mentality to the iPad. iOS 9's new iPad keyboard opens the whole system up to faster productivity with a series of shortcuts that flank the predictive text options. Along with the shortcut buttons, the keyboard can also double as a trackpad so you don't have to fumble with the text selection handles. And if you use a Bluetooth keyboard there are OS X-like keystroke shortcuts for quick app-switching and searching.\nBy bringing quick keys and a virtual trackpad, Apple is finally letting the iPad rub elbows with the Mac, giving us a way to navigate text, access files and browse photos with ease. The iPad's QuickType refinements aren't just about freeing our fingersthey elevate Apple's tablet to a whole new level of productivity and efficiency, and open up the platform for even bigger changes.\nWe've been reading about rumors of the iPad Pro for years, but multitasking has always been the highest hurdle Apple had to clear before it could become a reality. Using a MacBook-sized screen without any way to run more than one app at a time is a non-starter, and the idea of a 12-inch iPad always seemed like too much screen for this incarnation of iOS. But iOS 9 is the first clue from Apple that it's beginning to think big.\nThe multitasking system it devised is clearly built for larger screens. While we could certainly see the iPhone 6S Plus take advantage of Slide Over and maybe even Picture in Picture, Apple has so far reserved its Split Screen mode for the iPad Air 2, where it has room to breathe. And with an even bigger screen, Apple's iOS multitasking could be an absolute thing of beauty, perhaps even letting us run up to four apps in quadrants and taking advantage of its inevitable Force Touch technology to quickly switch between screens and views.\nApple has opened up a world of potential with iOS 9, not just for the iPad but for the apps that run on it. With the iPad emerging as a true post-PC device, we'll begin to approach what we do on it differently too. Tasks that weren't natural before will become commonplace as developers explore ways to use the Slide Out, Split View, and Picture in Picture to their advantage. The main purpose of the iPad was always to allow for iPhone developers to super-size their apps in terms of size and scale, with extra functionality and smarter interfaces that redefine our expectations of a mobile app. iOS 9 challenges that convention even more, shifting the iPad experience closer to the Mac and letting the tablet finally step out of the iPhone's shadow.\nIt's not just about running two or even three apps at the same time. It's about doing more than we ever dreamed possible on a multitouch device."

        "text": "“Personal Branding” is extremely important in today’s digital economy. Knowing how to effectively manage it is equally important, if not more so.\nThe question is whether you will take control of it… because if you don’t someone else will (or the masses).\nI decided that I’d rather manage it instead of the social media landscape that could do whatever they wanted with it, for better or for worse really.\nSo, I bought JohnSaddington.com (site has changed, link to DEMO below) and just sat on it for awhile, but I wasn’t sure what I should do with it.\nObviously it couldn’t stay like that. At first I thought I should purchase some ready-made website (like GetNectar.com who was an obvious inspiration but will set you back 200 bucks or so… but they do have some amazing other versions and flavors!) or off-the-shelf app or theme. … Bleh. I knew I could do better for free.\nSo, I set out to develop a WordPress theme that would help do that in a creative and attractive way. I wanted something simple, elegant, and super easy to change as my brand changed. I wanted it super light weight, memorable, and had elements that mattered.\nI also wanted to make it readily available at no cost to my friends, family, and many others, especially in today’s economy.\nI’ve had a lot of friends laid off recently and as they search for jobs and as businesses/recruiters/HR managers review their credentials and use Google to help find the “real” you (hopefully they don’t find the MySpace picture of you half-naked and piss-drunk) wouldn’t it be nice, I thought, if they found YourName.com instead with an attractive and impactful first impression?\nSo the Ipseity Personal Branding WordPress Theme was born.\n“Ipseity” means selfhood, or individual identity. I couldn’t think of a better name for the theme (and I wanted something original).\nIt’s powered by WordPress, it’s super light weight, around 150kb total file size (without background images), only 3 .php files, 1 .css file, and 2 essential .gifs (the arrow keys), and a js folder for the side-scrolling action.\nIt’s also easily styled with H1/H2/H3 tags and you can add images… heck, you could even make it a photo portfolio with style!\nI’ve included a few backgrounds for inspiration as you can see as well as a few screenshots of how to control the styling. It’s pretty simple and straightforward.\nI made it super easy to manage, update, and change.\nEach section is just a single blog entry/post.\nI’ve even included “dummy data” for you to import into your WordPress install so you can get started even faster.\nThe following images show you how it all works (there’s not much…).\nIf you want to add images like the last example, just make sure that they are 940 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall to fit perfectly into the theme.\nThe theme is pretty strict in terms of width, so I wouldn’t deviate from these dimensions, unless you do something like a much smaller image for a bio image.\nAgain, you could have an all-image gallery for your personal brand or portfolio.\nMix it up with alternating images and text.\nTo manage the actual text, I’m just using H1/H2/H3 tags for the main title and copy below.\nThe regular “paragraph” text is available to use as well, of course.\nOk. I’m Ready. I Want To Download It!\nHere you go. Have fun and tell others!\nPlease feel free to comment and leave examples of your personal brand site using Ipseity! It’ll help other people visualize what others have done with the theme and the possibilities. Think of it as a community activity.\nAgain, feel free to leave your thoughts, comments, and “improvements”…! And let me know if you use it! I want to see some kickbutt examples!\nOh, and one final thing: If you need a cheap (but good and legit) host to get a new .com website, check out this deal I’m sporting here with Dreamhost.com!"

I knew up until then that this was supposed to be the final season but after seeing the last episode, I could see another see another season.\nSo lame that the show was cancelled…..I had so much fun copying the ideas of the shows writers for all the parties!\nI am going to miss the Pakistani chick. What a body. Sweet dream!\nI had NO idea the series was canceled!!! This blows!!!! Why do they cancel the good shows and keep the worst!?!?!?!?\nSo sad to see these characters say goodbye to these characters, this show had room to grow and to introduce more great actors.\nDepressing I find out having to google this while watching the show, realizing this didn’t seem like a season finale…more like a forever good-bye.\nThis show is one of the Best they have made in a long time. It was a great ending,except that KT was ton down it made me cry. Couldn’t they just have remodled it honestly why do that and not give us a next season its messed up. UGH just sad to see it go. WE ALL LOVE YOU GREEK CAST!!!!\n“Greek” was probably the most realistic portrayal of Greek life on college campus that I have ever seen. Those were the best years of my life and a lot of the stuff on the show paralleled my own experiences. But I guess ABCFamily is more interested in bitchy little teenagers and all their drama. “Greek” will be missed.\nMy wife and I made it a ritual to watch Greek together every week. We generally have different tastes when it comes to TV, but this was a great show that we both liked. The final episode was great, and they were wrong to cancel it. However, I have seen what happens when you take a show about school and take it to far (Saved by the Bell: The College Years). I guess it is good they didn’t go out like that. KT FOREVER!\nI loved this show, Greek was one of my absolute favorite shows. I am really sad they decided to cancel it and I have no idea why. I hope the cast move on to other things that I will enjoy in the future.\nI agree, as they could still show cappie and cassie..have them make visits etc…I think thye should continue it..\nI thought it was a good ending saying goodbye.\nI had suspected this was the final season when they said “The Final Semester” and that their was only 10 episodes instead of 20 this season.\nHi I just watched the series finale!\nI lost Ugly Betty and that had some good times!"

        "text": "I attended the Independent Paris trip last fall and the activity description is very accurate. Some of our group had a hard time keeping up.If its something you are really interested n, \"train\" first, walk more, take more stairs, stand more. You will get an idea of how you will manage. The RS people can help you find something similar but less active .\nWe just returned from The Complete Ecuador program which was labeled \"active\". Most of the programs we've taken have been labeled active and were fine for us. This one, however, was occasionally more active that we anticipated: 2 hikes and 2 snorkeling expeditions in one day in the Galapagos, for example, stretched us because of the heat. We found, however, that so long as you tell the leader that you plan to sit out an activity, it's okay to do that.\nI like to challenge myself, however, I do train for my trips (I do a lot of hiking trips.). I have found the descriptions for challenging and moderately challenging trips to be pretty accurate. I read the daily itinerary closely and the comments from prior participants. I have found most of the group leaders very accommodating to participants who are having difficulty or chose to sit out a day. Try a program that is one activity level higher that what you usually chose to see if you enjoy it.\nAm planning my first RS trip in November to the Canyonlands but would like to include my two cents in response to your question, and only because I learned by experience the hard way. I consider myself to be a young and fairly fit and athletic early fifties female, but when the description merits a rating of active/challenging, etc--take heed of it! The burden is on the participant to manage that level of activity for the benefit of the entire group and not to over - reach their abilities only to be the tail-dragger or chair-sitter. I would definitely err on UNDER -estimating my abilities and taking a level below what I think I can manage -- it will still be a challenge and a great experience! This is knowledge based on an REI Adventures trip to the Scottish Highlands and Rick Steves trips to Ireland & Sicily. Be conservative when in doubt.\nCheck the trip details closely. If something may be above your capabilities, do you have an alternative activity you can do without delaying the group? Be aware elevation can make a huge difference if you are mobility impaired. If you use a wheelchair, recognize there is a huge difference in sizes of chairs. Be honest about your capabilities. Do you have someone to locate ramps or curb cuts or will you need extra time to locate them? How much time is needed to safely avoid hitting wayward children in crowds? Specify your needs early to those organizing the group so some accommodations might be arranged where possible. Be open to last minute changes.\nI would like to do the program in Dordogne, France, but the notes indicate participants need to be able to walk up to 9 miles a day! I might be able to do 9 miles, but the next day I would be useless.\nDo not pick a trip that is above your fitness level. It is not fair to your guides or fellow travelers. I have been on a hiking trip rated as \" moderately challenging\" in which a participant who had never exercised was unable to keep up. The guides were kind and understanding but had to consult with the main office to determine how to handle it. The decision was to allow the participant to stay but not do the group hikes. Please be considerate of your fellow travelers.\nI have to disagree with you on this one. Choosing an activity level that is higher than your normal activity can actually ruin your trip . If you are sore all the time from the activity it detracts from your enjoyment. If others have to constantly wait for you or assist you it detracts from their enjoyment.\nThe activity rankings can be very subjective. Happily, now that the RS discussion board is back, you can ask members about a specific trip. When we went on a RS trip to Cuba - active- I worried about keeping up. Turned out to be fine - the guide was very flexible and offered alternate activities and nobody felt held up.\nWe took a moderately challenging hiking trip to Death Valley and had a great time. I was told that the hiking range in the description includes the farthest hike, so if most of the walks are 3-4 miles and one is 6 miles, the range will list -6 miles. Please take into account elevation too. A 6 mile hike in Death Valley may be a piece of cake compared to the Rocky Mountains.\nPerfect response. It is subjective. On a recent trip, which I found easy peasy, not so much for others. The days were not challenging but the schedule was. On The Road trips are exactly that: pack up and go, tour, travel, eat, travel, tour, travel,eat, sleep and get up the next day and do it again. I like it but some of the not On The Road people found the schedule challenging and it had nothing to do with age or fitness. Know your limits. Challenging yourself if good but within what you can hope to do within reason.\nHas anyone one done the cycling tour in Tuscany? If so, what wa your experience? How difficult is his?\nWe have done about 20 RS programs over the past 20 years. Now \"Active\" the the best we can do. I like the riverboats because you can stay on the boat if you are unable to do a specificly strenious excursion. Since the boats dock in cities you can enjoy the \"cafe society\" instead."

Landscape planning of large tracts of land, architectural design within the public realm, and the design of urban areas have all featured in our portfolio. Our involvement with projects in the Middle East has allowed us to provide design solutions that incorporate indigenous and sustainable qualities in both building and landscape projects, as well as providing modern solutions in rapidly developing locations.\nshared design goal through collaboration. This blending of knowledge and expertise in allied disciplines invariably leads to the adoption of well-grounded design principles, ultimately reflected in a harmonious and successful end product. Our company is often faced with optimising the benefits of development for our clients, while still maintaining a wider stewardship of environmental features and values. As facilitators of land planning and design, we are well placed to create places that have meaning, function and a sensitivity for environmental and social purposes. The end result of our work is about creating inspirational places and communities.\nThom is a director of Christchurch based architectural firm Thom Craig Architects LTD (TCA Ltd) with 35 years of experience in New Zealand, South Africa, England, Asia and Middle East. As a previous Director of Warren and Mahoney and MAP, Thom has received more than 30 NZIA awards to date.\nAs our Middle East based business development manager, Roslan is an experienced mechanical engineer, consultant and project planner.\nMasterplanner and Landscape Architect. Over 35 years experience in projects throughout New Zealand, Malaysia, China and Middle East. Invited guest speaker at IFLA Congresses. Past Chairman NZILA (Canterbury Branch ).\nRoslan has also worked and lectured in Malaysia and New Zealand.\nHANMER SPRINGS NEW ZEALAND At New Zealandâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s most popular tourist attraction, a thermal alpine wonderland has been created. The design embraces an abstraction of nature using local materials, colours and vegetation. Elements include the design of streams, pools, planting, shade structures, rock work and bridges.\nAL BAYT STADIUM QATAR The Al Bayt Stadium in Qatar will become a centre piece for the 2022 Football World Cup. The stadium landscape will impact a powerful message. The design inspiration is based on an abstraction of the Arabian desert with the plaza being located on the high plateau with wadis running off the plateau as waterfalls which form oases and give life to plants. A sadu pattern within the paving creates a local identity which complements the stadiumâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s indigenous pattern. Our seamless approach to this project integrates the disciplines of landscape, architecture, lighting, irrigation and engineering into a comprehensive and coherent whole. The project was undertaken in conjunction with QDC Engineers, who managed the design process.\nThe various designs for the restaurants, kiosks and activity nodes enhance the spirit of this place beyond the focus of the 2022 World Cup. As with the design of the main stadium building, these various ancillary structures maximise the functional use of their varied enclosures with the use of macro and micro scaled outcomes that includes the use of master planning, materials, structural solutions, and interior ‘drama’. That delivers a flexible design that supports the intended design use.\nNote: Concept plan only. Areas are approximate and subject to final scheme plan & survey.\nK ATARA PARK QATAR As part of the competition, the design for this 50ha parkland in Doha, Qatar has been strongly influenced by nature itself. It will be a parkland of topographical features, a stream with ponds and falls; trees and shrubland; and a complexity of small spaces with paths to encourage adventure. The design proposes a rich image of shade and shelter, of recessively placed buildings in a modernised and naturalised community for the introduction of bird life. It will symbolise a retreat from the world to a cool oasis which will foster harmony and enjoyment. The naturalistic forms celebrate the sound and sight of water, emphasises the spirit of harmony in nature.\nGRAND HERITAGE HOTEL QATAR The early 18th Century English garden served as the principal design influence for the design of the Aspire Hotel in Doha, Qatar. The design is structured by water and path axes with parterres, pools and foundations, follies, a band rotunda, boat house, a maze, pergolas, copses of trees and undulating land forms. The project was undertaken in conjunction with QDC.\nK ATARA MALL DOHA, QATAR Located near to the Doha seafront, this is a high quality mall with retail shops and fine dining restaurants for locals and tourists to enjoy. Our role was to assist QDC with the entrances, car parking and landscape design throughout and give a sense of grandeur.\nAL EMADI VILLAGE DOHA, QATAR CGLA played a key role in the masterplanning and design of the streetscape and open space in this urban development in Doha. A large outdoor space for fine dining, promenading and socialisation. Classical elegance portrayed with landscape components of bridges, pergolas, plants lighting and water. An outdoor cooling system will allow for usage during hot conditions.\nDOHA SK ATE PARK QATAR Polis Group has recently delivered a design for Dohaâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s primary public skate park, set into a newly developed part of the Corniche area. Construction is currently progressing. The design caters for a range of abilities from beginner to advanced, also integrating planting, seating and shade elements into the design.\nDOHA PORT STADUM QATAR The Doha Port FIFA World Cup Stadium will be an exciting, sustainable waterfront venue for spectators and players. The stadium design is an innovative, sustainable demountable design. Once removed, the surrounding landscape and seafront will become a stunning, vibrant framework for legacy projects to be built around. Spaces surrounding the stadium will provide green oases with canopy trees, enclosed courtyards for shade and relaxation. Use of water draws a connection towards the ocean and the seafront where recreation, play and delight are fused together to create a vibrant, exciting public space.\nDOHA CORNICHE QATAR Polis Group has recently undertaken conceptual work for an extention to the Corniche in Doha. The work focuses on access and seafront improvements along a 3km stretch of the Doha coast, which connects the Doha Port World Cup Stadium to the existing corniche. The design incorporates several nodes of activity which include public spaces and facilities including shade, play, kiosks, cafes, fan zones, an ecological reserve area, boardwalks, and use of existing features such as jettys and pontoons.\nMT COOK NATIONAL PARK NEW ZEALAND The design at Mount Cook Village has created a distinct and attractive area with a sense of arrival for visitation. Connections and linkages are established with the surrounding facilities through roading and pathways. The use of local materials and colour schemes integrates the design into the environment. For housing units, an indigenous alpine landscape has been created with the mounded periphery. The use of boulders, woodsets, bridge beams and alpine shrubs as landscape features help to relate the place to its context.\nCAIRO HOUSING EGYPT The Kasbah includes the design of Egyptian vernacular architecture in a modern idiom incorporating gardens, shade and water with different styles and densities of housing.\nALMARAI BOTTLING PLANT SAUDI ARABIA This proposed development to the NW of Riyadh for a fresh water bottling plant is based around a central shaded forecourt and water feature. This provides the focus for the overall development which includes a museum, offices, conference facilities, mosque, production, bottling plant, and housing, linked to the development by a landscaped spine.\nEAST COAST TIANJIN CHINA This coastal location of a 10ha mixed use and multi-storied village includes apartments, open space, retail, roading and car parks. The design is based on the mythical journey of Odysseus, from Homer’s “Odyssey”.

        "text": "Oliver, the longest-tenured NFL sideline reporter, a fixture at games since joining FOX Sports in 1995, continues in that role, this year working with play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and analyst John Lynch.\nLos Angeles - Pam Oliver, one of the premier reporters and interviewers in sports television, has been elevated to senior correspondent, FOX Sports, effectively immediately. The announcement was made today by Eric Shanks, President, COO and Executive Producer, FOX Sports. Oliver, the longest-tenured NFL sideline reporter, a fixture at games since joining FOX Sports in 1995, continues in that role, this year working with play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and analyst John Lynch.\nIn Oliver's new position, she expands her influence beyond the NFL to include the wide breadth of sports and events covered by FOX Sports year-round, with her exclusive interviews, commentary and essays featured on a variety of FOX Sports programs and platforms, including FOX NFL SUNDAY, FOX SPORTS LIVE, AMERICA'S PREGAME, FOX SPORTS 1 ON 1, college football and basketball and FOXSports.com.\n\"FOX Sports has grown tremendously over the last few years, and we've secured and retained the rights to many of the country's most popular sports,\" said Shanks. \"After years of admiring Pam's consistently incredible work on the NFL, we realized that there was so much more she could do for us, on a variety of sports, all year long. Her intelligence and skills as a reporter and interviewer are unparalleled, and we're excited to have her take a much larger role here.\"\n\"I'm excited and grateful to my Fox family for providing this thrilling new chapter in my career,\" said Oliver. \"I'm over the moon for the opportunity to expand my contributions to include a wider variety of sports and programs, while still getting to report from the sidelines on NFL Sundays. I've already spoken with Kevin and John and I'm really looking forward to being part of their outstanding team this season, my 20th and final season the sidelines.\"\nArmed with the respect and esteem of NFL players, coaches and executives alike, Oliver's straightforward and direct interviewing style consistently produced topical and substantive reports which she'll now apply to the greater sports universe.\nIn her 19 years covering the NFL for FOX Sports, Oliver has worked the sideline for over 350 games, including 19 NFC Championship Games and seven Super Bowls. In addition, she's provided hundreds of exclusive one-one interviews with the sports' news-making athletes, coaches and owners. She also served as co-anchor of FSN South's SOUTHERN SPORTS REPORT from 2000 to 2003, and also contributes to Turner Sports coverage of the NBA playoffs.\nIn 2008, Oliver was honored by WISE (Women In Sports and Events) and chosen in their \"Women of the Year\" class alongside Rita Benson LeBlanc, Owner and Executive Vice President, New Orleans Saints and Molly Solomon, Coordinating Producer, NBC Olympics.\nBefore joining FOX Sports, Oliver served as a reporter at ESPN, where she covered NFL regular and postseason games, the NBA Finals and Dream Team II at the 1995 World Championships of Basketball.\nPrior to joining ESPN, Oliver worked at KHOU in Houston WTVT in Tampa as a sports reporter and anchor. Hers additional career stops include WIVB in Buffalo, WAAY in Huntsville, Ala., WALB in Albany, Ga., and WFSU in Tallahassee. Oliver began her broadcasting career as a community affairs reporter for public television.\nA graduate of Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Oliver received her degree in broadcast journalism. As an undergraduate, she held school records in the 400 meters and was an AIAW track and field All-American in both the 400 meters and the mile relay, and as a member of the mile relay team, she had the distinction of participating on the first women's team from Florida A&M to win a national championship (AIAW.)

        "text": "In case you missed it, the initials ICYMI stand for the first five words of this sentence. In the event you have, indeed, missed it (ITEYH, I, MI has not taken off yet for some reason), it’s most likely because you’re not on the Internet much, particularly Twitter, where individuals and outlets deploy it every few seconds to bring links to the attention of others who may not have seen them. The New York Times now even has a section at the bottom of its app called “In Case You Missed It” with articles from previous days.\nWhile the extended phrase has been used in conversation for a long time, the shorthand betrays an anxiety central to the Internet epoch. There is simply too much readable, viewable and listenable data for anyone to stay abreast of, as a humor piece, “I’m All Caught Up!” by Nick Mickowski in McSweeney’s, playfully suggested.\nWe used to receive media cyclically. Newspapers were published once (or sometimes twice) a day, magazines weekly or monthly. Nightly news was broadcast, well, each night. Television programs were broadcast on one of the major networks one night a week at a specific time, never to return until a rerun or syndication. Movies were shown first in theaters and on video much later (or, before the advent of VCRs, not until a revival). There were not many interstices, just discrete units — and a smaller number of them.\nNow we’re in the midst of the streaming era, when the news industry distributes material on a 24-hour cycle, entire seasons of TV shows are dumped on viewers instantaneously, most movies are available at any time and the flow of the Internet and social media is ceaseless. We are nearly all interstitial space, with comparatively few singularities.\nThe cumulative effect is overwhelming for both producers of content and its consumers. Those who put out work, understandably, want to make sure it’s not lost on whatever site is hosting it, let alone in the social media blizzard of “must read” links, one-off jokes and other self-promotion. When the home page of a website refreshes every couple of hours (or minutes), there aren’t a lot of conspicuous ways to showcase older material except through the referrals of Twitter, Facebook and the like.\nToday, both the outlets and the individuals who are responsible for the work are aware that they have a limited window in which their content can go viral and outlive its short stay on a home page. When it fails to do so, as, by definition, almost everything must, it may seem to them like a disheartening screen-age Zen koan: If an article about deforestation is published but no one clicks on it, did it actually exist?\nHence ICYMI. In an earlier time, the full verbal formulation meant that the recipient was supposed to see something of a certain degree of importance (a note, an email), and the sender was gently reminding you of its oversight.\nNow, the very shortening of the phrase is a byproduct and acknowledgment of the velocity of information against which its attached link is racing. The implication is that you probably have not seen it, and it’s not necessary to your existence, but the sender would like to bring it to your attention anyway, please. It serves as a call of desperation as much as an announcement: Can you hear my whisper in these howling winds? In fact, ICYMI is often used as the second or third attempt to link to something (which suggests the content is not taking off organically) as a means of excusing the repetitive promotion.\nEven the Twitter account for President Obama, one of the few people who can assume that his actions are never missed by the world, occasionally uses ICYMI, especially to highlight achievements the White House may think are undervalued by the public, such as job growth and the Affordable Care Act.\nElissa Strauss, a columnist for TheWeek.com and a freelancer for a number of other Web publications, said that a financial incentive also drives Internet content creators who post their work multiple times (she said she typically “triple tweets” each of her articles).\nGiven the near-infinite accessibility of digital media, it suggests that what Walter Benjamin called the unique, mystical “aura” of an object of art in his seminal 1936 essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” greatly diminished by the reproductive technologies of his time, is completely eradicated by ours.\nLive performances may be the last place to locate any sense of aura. Mr. Benjamin saw various reasons for optimism in the diminution of the aura. Reproduction, he posited, could emancipate us from cultlike reverence toward art and make us keener, more politicized critics. But nowadays it’s passé to note that, during live events, people are often staring into their reproduction-friendly phones, perhaps a redirected form of ritual obeisance.\nAt least they can probably find a video or photo (maybe one they shot themselves) of what they were at later, in case they missed it.\nComing Soon: Sign up to receive our NYT Living newsletter, a weekly roundup lifestyle news from the Style, Travel, Food and Home sections delivered to your inbox."

This means they search passengers and their luggage for anything harmful (like weapons, drugs, and bombs) by using equipment that may include metal detectors, x-ray machines, and cameras. Other duties include educating travelers, recording information about luggage that set off alarms, watching for those who have their pictures posted at checkpoints, and overseeing several transportation related responsibilities of the federal government when a national emergency occurs.\nTo apply for this position, you must be: at least eighteen years of age, a U.S. citizen or a U.S. national, fluent in English, dependable, able to carry or lift as much as seventy pounds, and able to remain focused (especially in highly stressful situations).\nThe TSA performs a background check on all prospective screeners. It will either be a traditional investigation or a single-scope background investigation, which is more complex. The traditional looks into employment & criminal history, and financial records, while the single-scope check also involves interviewing colleagues and neighbors.\nNew hires must undergo 120 hours of training before they are permitted to screen passengers. To maintain agency certification, screeners must pass an annual written examination and image interpretation. While on the job, training never stops as at times, undercover TSA agents attempt to get by security with contraband.\nJob advancement is available to TSA screeners who have good job performance along with educational and professional credentials. Positions include bomb appraisal officer, transportation security manager, and TSA trainer.\nAir marshals (also called sky marshals) fly undercover on airplanes around the world in order to protect passengers and crews from hostile acts. They usually fly 181 days per year, and their responsibilities include identifying suspicious activity, evaluating the environment, and conducting investigations in an attempt to protect the airline from a terroristic attack.\nCandidates must be under the age of forty and hold a bachelor's degree or higher. They also need to have at least three years of administrative, investigative, professional, or technical experience. Those who make it past the highly competitive first round, will face an extensive background check, fingerprinting, drug testing, mental health screenings, and an interview with officials.\nThe mandatory, comprehensive training program prepares all candidates to take to the sky. They spend the first thirty-five days of the basic training program at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in New Mexico before relocating to Atlantic City, New Jersey for forty-three days. After completion, candidates who gain employment with the Federal Air Marshall Service must then take part in a sixteen week training program. At this time, they learn things such as aircraft medicine, aircraft safety, how to recognize both criminal and terroristic behavior, international law, and how to lawfully arrest suspects. They also learn close quarter self-defense and how to use firearms.\nAlong with working at airports, air marshals can also find employment with the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the National Targeting Center.\nAir marshals who have experience and a good record can be promoted to a supervisory position or senior management."

Women must work outside of the home to earn enough for family survival. Women are not willing to do a second shift of domestic labor at home after working all day in the market place."

PhD thesis, University of York.\nNetworks-On-Chip (NoC) is seen as a solution for addressing the limitation of the current bus-based communication in embedded systems. Some of these systems are designed for executing hard real-time services. In such systems, the services have to deliver output within strict timing constraints since the lateness in output delivery could cause severe consequences to human life. Task mapping is a crucial step for integrating an application and a hardware platform during system design. Existing schedulability analyses are available to evaluate the hard real-time performance of task mapping, but exploring the vast number of task mappings at the early design stage can be challenging due to several issues. These issues are caused by the influence of other design parameters on the hard real-time performance produced by task mapping, the existence of conflicting design objectives with the hard real-time system constraints, the restriction of the current hard real-time evaluation functions for searching alternative task mappings and the enormous evaluation of population-based search heuristics in the current task mapping techniques. This thesis proposes several design space exploration techniques to address these issues. The first technique is proposed for addressing the problem of optimising multiple design parameters while keeping all tasks and messages in the system fully schedulable. The second technique addresses the conflicting objectives problem using a multi-objective optimisation approach. The third technique yields a new metric that is useful for improving task mappings with unschedulable tasks and messages. Finally, the last technique is a new mapping algorithm for constructing a feasible task mapping rather than have to evaluate a population of task mappings to achieve the same objective."

        "text": "The Fernando Alonso that fell foul of tyre degradation and Webber’s end of race pace in Silverstone prevailed here in Germany. The strategy worked for him in qualifying superbly and here it preserved and protected his race win, giving the Spaniard a comfortable lead over his closest competitors of the Red Bull Racing duo. Alonso controlled the race with ease, and it was only in the latter stages of the race that he had any company in the form of a resurgent Jenson Button and then a suddenly interested Sebastian Vettel. But unlike Silverstone he had enough left in reserve to manage Button, who had chipped the gap down to under a second in places.\nIt would have been a sweet result if Lewis Hamilton could have emulated his team mate’s result on his 200th race, however it wasn’t meant to be. A right rear puncture scuppered his race completely, and his subsequent calls to be retired must have raised some eyebrows in his garage as he was then encouraged to continue.\nDamage was certainly possible as Hamilton reported the car felt unstable, cue more team pep talks, but the he delivered a fastest lap and on lap 35 he was comfortable enough to overtake Vettel around turn 6. Which led to eyebrows being raised at Red Bull, with Button then 3 seconds behind Vettel, Hamilton was asked not to hold him up. On lap 58 Hamilton was wheeled into his garage, leaving him open to a penalty free gearbox change is he needs one. Although this is a great advantage under a ‘technical retirement’, it just doesn’t mesh well will the ‘spirit’ of racing.\nPaul di Resta almost secured a point, but a Rosberg on fresh rubber nicked that, but the British driver was involved in two excellent demonstrations of racecraft. It was just a shame he was on the raw end of the deal both times. On lap 5 Raikkonen proved he wasn’t at all race rusty, and just to hammer the point home he followed Schumacher around the Force India on lap 15.\nSergio Perez (along with Nico Rosberg) made up a fantastic 11 positions today, starting in a lowly 17th he rose through the ranks quickly and yet again showed his ability behind the wheel. The team itself commented on how they had lost points they shouldn’t have and were looking to make up for that. And that they did in Germany. The Mexican wasn’t alone in his plight, the recently rumoured under-pressure Kamui Kobayashi grabbed his best ever result of P4 (thanks to a Vettel penalty) which should go some way in apologising for mowing over his mechanics at Silverstone.\nMark Webber was the most notable loser today (bar Hamilton, but there’s not much you can do after a puncture), after his 5 grid place drop he did little to get further up the standings than that. Although he got past Hamilton at the start he was mired behind Maldonado much longer than he should have been, then a switch to the medium compound left him with little confidence in the car. A surprise tussle with Vitaly Petrov after a pit stop on lap 14 spoke of his day, much like Button at Silverstone, he was fighting with the wrong people.\nIt wasn’t just Hamilton whose race suffered as a result of some early doors bad luck. Romain Grosjean should have been able to haul himself up the field with definite pace here with the aptitude shown at Silverstone. However his day was an all too familiar repeat of his earlier 2012 outings, mistakes here and there and contact on his first lap resulted in a broken front wing and a puncture. Felipe Massa dumped his front wing into the back of Ricciardo within moments of the lights going out, which could have hampered his race, but he clawed himself up to 12th. Heikki Kovalainen was going well but after suffering a right front flap failure, all he could do was run to the end of the race.\nRed Bull Racing had a scare first thing when their engine mapping was put under the microscope, but after they were cleared it was just Webber’s 5 place grid drop they had to contend with. Until lap 66 anyway. Vettel tried to make a move on Button around the outside at turn 6, but as Button ran to the line but instead of backing out Vettel used the painted run-off area. Citing he had to use to the run off to avoid a collision Vettel thought he was safe, Button’s team had other ideas, and the stewards agreed. If he had given the place back Vettel would have finished 3rd, but after having 20 seconds added to his time he finished the day in fifth. Raikkonen got a trophy without having to participate in the podium interview and Kobayashi got his best ever finish.\nAfter pit stop woes became a race weekend norm for the McLaren garage, any clean tyre change was welcome regardless of time. But in Germany the crew pulled together a true blink-and-you-miss-it moment when Jenson Button’s car was stationary for an incredible 2.31 seconds.\nYes there were flashes, but they didn’t come at the right time. Button almost turned his fortunes around, but he was only given enough luck to muster second. Mercedes were struck down by fuel saving. Webber donned an invisibility cloak. Maldonado, although drama free, didn’t capitalise on his qualifying pace and paid heavily for tyre degradation. However Sauber made a timely reappearance and Raikkonen featured where he should be."

As a kid I often lied about reading books whether how much or at all. They were always too long winded and boring for me, possibly like my blog posts… I became a master ‘skimmer’ at a young age, which I’m ashamed enough to admit followed me all the way through Graduate School and really helped through most of my “required” readings. In any case, the readings I found that fit my attention span were inside of National Geographic magazines. In these magazines I first laid eyes on amazing beautiful places and animal species in nature that I had never seen before or even knew existed! This amazement & curiosity fueled my desire to travel and see the world to which I began doing on my own in 2008. My first stop was the Grand Canyon, then Rocky Mountain National Park, so on & so forth. Sometimes I travel with a companion. More often I travel alone.\nTraveling and hiking in remote places awards me a peace & freedom I often do not find in society. I also have the pleasure of watching animals in their natural habitat as they were meant to be seen. All this has fueled my passion for photography as well. Similar to my work as a Therapist & Coach, I am able to use my keen abilities in observation to capture some of the most beautiful moments that nature blesses us with. I’ve been a keen observer of others and my surroundings for as long as I can remember. It has fueled my abilities to work in various trades such as being a lifeguard, swim coach, photo developer, anthropology undergrad, martial arts instructor, photographer, & therapist. Inversely, my experience in each of these trades has helped my abilities in focusing on various perspectives through observation over time as well.\nThere are beautiful moments all around us all of the time. Each beautiful moment in time requires its own unique perspective which is subject to the eye of the beholder. Some moments are large and everlasting like the Torres del Paine mountain range or Grand Canyon which formed over millions of years. Some moments are small such as a butterfly on your fingertip and some moments are quick like a dolphin that briefly jumps out of the ocean for just a second.\nWhatever the case, these beautiful moments in life that take place in nature or inside our heads is what I focus on through my work as a Therapist, Coach, Traveler & Photographer.\nMy name is Tony. The kids I’ve helped over the years refer to me as Mr. Tony. This blog contains various chronicles from my life & travels. My purpose in writing these blogs are to reflect upon where I’ve been, what I’ve learned and to ultimately inspire you to get out there, travel, & experience a more meaningful part of life for yourself as well.\nSafe travels? No. Get out there, make mistakes, push yourself past your limits & learn more about yourself than you’ve ever known. Then you’ll have stories of your own to share."

Chanda could answer yes…but she chooses not to. Instead, she has chosen to overcome with a smile when there is nothing to smile about and give to others out of her poverty. Amidst the dreary circumstances she calls life, Chanda’s beauty and strength rises higher.\nChanda lives in Sermapore, India with her parents and six siblings where one bed sleeps all the children. Her father is a rickshaw driver and her mother is a maid. Together they barely bring home enough money to feed their family of 10 with rotted food. Her father usually returns from work drunk and abusive. If these circumstances were not grim enough, Chanda was born with Cardiomegaly, commonly known as an enlarged heart. Her condition causes shortness of breath and extreme fatigue keeping Chanda from basic tasks, but also from her passion – dancing. Without surgery, her condition would eventually cause an early death.\nBut, the heart surgery Chanda needed would never have been a possibility for this family except for the work of Calcutta Mercy Ministries. Through this ministry, Chanda received heart surgery at no cost to her family. Now, she is able to live without slowing down or avoiding certain activities due to her weak heart…she is even free to dance. Each of us can give wings to a child in need by giving them a chance to overcome their circumstances too.\n*All net proceeds from “Overcome” will be used to medically treat children in need through Calcutta Mercy Ministries."

Program host Dave James plans to stay awake for 28 hours of telethon-like coverage.\nThe day after Thanksgiving is traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year, called “Black Friday” because it’s key for many businesses to go in the black, or turn a profit. QVC, which competes with ShopNBC and the HSN home shopping network, has not wanted to get caught up in the frenzy and has always treated it as just another day for its sales pitches, said Doug Rose, the network’s vice president of programming and marketing.\n“This year, and we’ve been planning on this for many months, we really expect to join the fray with the other retailers,” Rose said.\nQVC is hoping for a “Black Friday” of its own. Hurt by the same recession that affected other retailers last year, QVC’s fourth quarter revenue in 2008 was down 8 percent from the previous year. So far this year revenue has been essentially flat, although the value of the items that QVC is selling is down slightly.\nThe network generally offers one “special value” item to customers each day. For “Black Friday” coverage, which starts at 8 p.m. EST on Thanksgiving, there will be three.\nEvery hour, there will be a specially priced offer, and there will be five hours of gifts that have never been available before on the network, QVC said.\nRival HSN, which has also been flat in sales this year, mailed one million gift guides for the first time to people who have bought things through the network in the past. It is also offering specially-priced items over the Thanksgiving weekend, although that’s not a shift from what it has done in the past.\nHSN also had a “Get Ready for the Holidays” programming theme for the first week of November, for people who wanted advice on cooking and decorating. HSN has a little more than half QVC’s sales domestically.\nJames, a former radio disc jockey, said the closest thing he’s come to his upcoming 28-hour marathon is hosting radiothons for about half the time. He said he’s working with a nutritionist to prepare him for the ordeal.\nHe’s convinced his family to have an early Thanksgiving dinner and hopes the turkey will let him have a long nap before he goes to QVC’s Pennsylvania studio.\n“There’s going to be coffee — a lot of coffee,” he said."

More unexpected is the strong showing of Thursday’s “Without a Trace,” which drew just under 16 million viewers last week despite competing against “ER” (which had 24.7 million viewers).\nThe new CBS shows on Wednesday and Friday, “Presidio Med” and “Robbery Homicide Division,” haven’t caught on, however.\nWith only two weeks of late-night ratings available, both Leno and Letterman are down 12 percent in viewers from last year. Both shows had a ratings boost last fall as more viewers stayed up late after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nRob Burnett, “Late Show” executive producer, said Letterman’s show has seen some strong ratings in big cities on Mondays and Thursdays.\nBut NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker said that because there’s been no change at all in the margin between the two late-night hosts, Letterman’s theory doesn’t hold water.\n“The fact of the matter is America decided between these two guys long ago,” Zucker said.\nIn prime time, CBS won the week. “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” with 30.7 million viewers, eclipsed NBC’s “Friends” as the week’s most popular show.\nCBS averaged 13.2 million viewers for the week (8.9 rating, 15 share), NBC had 12.4 million (8.3, 14), Fox, helped by the baseball playoffs, took third place with 10.1 million viewers (6.7, 11) and ABC had 10 million (6.4, 10).\nA ratings point represents 1,067,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation’s estimated 106.7 million TV homes.

But on the flip side of that coin, as humans we do not have to feel “settled.” Every day their is an opportunity to be better and strive for more than the day before. In the course of that drive, you may find the desire to pursue a different road then your dream. Thats ok. It was in the pursuit of yourself that started you on your path in the first place."

They live in constant fear for themselves and their families.\nI am sure you would be traveling down that road like them, leaving all you know and way of life for any chance for security. These are people who are willing to work and create a new life. They know hardships like you and I have never experienced or imagined. A lot of them are staying in Mexico, and Mexico is reaching out to them.\nWe used to do that before Trump.\nHowever, the basic problem is our system of immigration. I would shock you by saying, let all of them in after vetting each individual for criminal backgrounds.\nThen give them all green cards, social security numbers, and allow them to obtain a driver’s licenses after demonstrating basic English language skills. Then they could be ‘tracked’ like you and I are. If they cause a serious crime, they could be quickly located and deported.\nThey will take the menial jobs that are needed in order to get established and if the jobs run out, they will move on to other countries of opportunity.\nMeanwhile, we collect taxes on them and they support the various government agencies. Factories, farmers, and more are hurting for workers because of our present governmental policies. Someone needs to wake up and effect positive immigration, not a political devise to sow fear and rage.\nInstead, let us show compassion."

The livestream is also going to have news on Bandai’s other Dragon Ball fighting game, Xenoverse 2.\nBandai Namco has confirmed that both Masayuski Hirano, producer of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, and Tomoko Hiroki, producer of Dragon Ball FighterZ, will be special guests during the stream.\nIf you’re a fan of both or either game, you’ll want to catch this stream. Here’s all the information you’ll need including when it starts and how to watch it online.\nThe start time for the Dragon Ball FighterZ announcement livestream will begin at 7 p.m. EST and end around 8 p.m. EST.\nIf you’re looking for the Dragon Ball FighterZ and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 livestream, the best place to go is Bandai Namco’s official Twitch channel. You can watch the announcements live and interact with others in the Twitch chat.\nSo what can fans expect from this upcoming livestream? Speculation suggests that a season 2 of DLC characters will be announced for Dragon Ball FighterZ. During the fighting game’s first year, fans received Broly, Bardock, Cooler, Base Goku, Base Vegeta, Vegito, Fused Zamasu, and Android 17 as DLC fighters.\nThe final Dragon Ball FighterZ DLC, Android 17 and Cooler, was released in September. Since then there hasn’t been any significant content added to the game. With so many characters from the Dragon Ball universe to choose from, a Season 2 of DLC fighters would revitalize this popular game.\nAs for Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, there hasn’t been any shortage of content added to the game since its release. The two-year-old game has given fans plenty of characters and missions to enjoy, so this announcement could be about a number of things. We’re honestly hoping for a Xenoverse 3 announcement, but if that game was in the works we think it would be saved for a bigger stage like E3 2019.\nSo what do you think will be announced during the livestream? Which game is your favorite? Let us know in the comments section below."

[CautionExercise safety precautions in this procedure, as some substances may react with explosive violence when digested with hydrogen peroxide. ] Transfer 1.0 g of the substance under test to a suitable flask, add 5 mL of sulfuric acid and a few glass beads, and digest on a hot plate in a hood until charring begins. Other suitable means of heating may be substituted. (Add additional sulfuric acid, if necessary, to wet the substance completely, but do not add more than a total of 10 mL.) Add, dropwise and with caution, 30 percent hydrogen peroxide, allowing the reaction to subside and again heating between drops. Add the first few drops very slowly, mix carefully to prevent a rapid reaction, and discontinue heating if foaming becomes excessive. Swirl the solution in the flask to prevent unreacted substance from caking on the walls of the flask. [NoteAdd peroxide whenever the mixture turns brown or darkens. ] Continue the digestion until the substance is completely destroyed, copious fumes of sulfur trioxide are evolved, and the solution is colorless. Cool, cautiously add 10 mL of water, evaporate until sulfur trioxide again is evolved, and cool. Repeat this procedure with another 10 mL of water to remove any traces of hydrogen peroxide. Cautiously dilute with 10 mL of water, and cool."

I have a couple of small black walnuts that need to be cut down and a shag bark hickory that was damage in a storm. The tool I don’t have yet is a froe, which is used to split out blanks from a round log and a shaving horse will make the process easier, but not required. I have a draw knife that might be older than me so I do have to figure out how to sharpen it.\nMy plan is to cut lengths at about 6′, 4′ and 2′ and split out some handle blanks. This will cover the lengths of everything from a rake or hoe to a hammer. They will need to be seasoned of course and that means coating the ends so they don’t dry to quickly and cause the wood to split. There is something called Anchorseal that the lumber industry uses to for this purpose, but hobbyist also just use exterior grade latex paint.\nHaving a stock of handle material air-drying is an investment that every homesteader should do it they can. From what amounts to a chunk of firewood you can get a valuable resource for next to no money. Consider it an investment in future tool needs."

A prequalification letter can be done in a day or two. It is wise to have this early. Some sellers require that you have the letter prior to submitting an offer.\nOur team will work hard to find the right home at the right price. We won't hesitate to suggest you walk away if we believe it is not in your best interest.

Some of the sillier girls have been convinced by what they read in the papers that any young man not in uniform is an unpatriotic shirker. They do not seem to realise that with so many men joining the army even some former soldiers are finding it difficult to re-enlist. One young man who had served as an officer in the Territorials tried to rejoin his battalion as soon as the war began. The battalion was at full strength and he has been waiting for a commission in another regiment. He would be happy to join the ranks, but has heard that new Territorial battalions are being formed and hopes to be needed by one of them. Despite this he received a white feather in the post. It may also be that single men have family responsibilities, caring for parents or siblings, or are not fit enough to be accepted into the Forces. They say that although Lord Kitchener asked for 200,000 men to join up, over 300,000 have now enlisted and the War Office does not have the resources to equip or train all the new recruits. Even if there were cause to believe a young man may be shirking his duty and to tell him so with a white feather, it would surely be better to give it to him personally and give him a chance to explain himself rather than to take the coward’s course and send a feather anonymously."

Social-cognitive theory is grounded by various essential assumptions.\nIdentify and describe three or more theoretical perspectives which might be seen in the little group literature. Cognitive theorists think that student attitudes, motivation, and beliefs can affect the learning procedure. samedayessay.com review Learning theories are the primary guide for educational systems.\nTherefore, the best purpose of education is reaching to the last limit of the person growth potential. In assimilation, the person absorbs new info, fitting features of the surroundings into internal cognitive structures. Employing precisely the same bottoms do not create the very same actions.\nParticipants are liable for purchasing the necessary course textbook. You have to summarize the info from the article in your words Describe the sample. Information processing theory was developed and broadened through the years.\nThis methodology isn't self-sufficient. Maintenance means repetition, whilst elaboration denotes the organization of information (for instance, chunking or chronology). Mindfulness is important to the procedure for learning in many facets.\nThe signs of the people with depression then begin to get worse because of different people's rejection and avoidance of those. Currently, one particular theory is that neuroendocrine changes while pregnant and pos. One in 10 people are going to have some kind of depression during the course of their life.\nReinforcement can be positive or negative, but the important component is it will usually result in a change in an individual's behavior. Age, race, gender, and physical characteristics are only a few of the traits that one wants to compare as a way to analyze the potency of the model. Time spent with others in recovery lowers the sum of peer pressure to take part in addiction.\nDue to the exceptional advantage of simulation to nursing students, it's crucial it's implemented in a means that's thoughtful and mindful of its effect on students. Nursing Theory includes the learning the a number of models of nursing which were proposed. Second, it may be an event of the new graduates not knowing what they don't know, and therefore being not able to recognize the value of continuing education to the extent that the professional nurses do.\nThey will also make deals with each other and even adults. They will have a number of models with whom they identify. Therefore, the typical approach in teaching the children isn't appropriate for adult education.\nThe order where the stages occur have been shown to be largely invariant, no matter how the ages at which people enter each greater order stage vary according to every individual's hereditary and environmental characteristics. Interestingly, the kind of symbolic play in which children engage is connected with their degree of creativity and capacity to get in touch with other people. As of 2004 it's widely accepted that a kid's intellectual ability is dependent on a mix of heredity and environment.\nYou've got a nervous barking dog. At about two to four decades old, they cannot yet manipulate and transform information in a logical way. During this stage, they also become less egocentric and begin to think about how other people might think and feel.\nThe main point is that learning is a complicated procedure and students learn in a variety of ways. Each mathematics classroom will be different based on the actors within it. So for people who need assistance with writing, we've only the people they require!\nFor example, they are unable to make use of potential models of good writing acquired through reading because they have no understanding of how the authors produced such text. The student needs to be mindful that repeating a course may bring about a greater course price. They will be surprised at how easily they are able to answer the questions.\nTo attain this balance, the simplest approach is to realize the new experiences throughout the lens of the preexisting ideas. One other important role of post-purchase evaluation for fashionable products is the decrease in uncertainty that consumer might have concerning their selection. The information gives insight into the dynamics that affect performance along with solutions and methods to boost performance.\nThe standard of learning during simulation is just like the scenario and the debriefing and isn't dependent upon the scale of the available equipment. Covert modeling can be run by utilizing advertising which makes it possible for the modeled behavior and cognitions to be readily imagined. Bloom's model has a lot of helpful applications in the classroom.\nThere are several different beliefs about how folks learn. The notion differs from Skinner who believes that we cannot learn something until we've actually engaged in that behavior. Understanding and understanding how to use full common sense hasn't yet been completely adapted.\nGestalt psychologists criticize behaviorists for being too determined by overt behavior to spell out learning. Various learning techniques are employed in the classroom as there are various learning styles. Observational Learning learning from different people with observing them is a good way of gaining knowledge and altering behavior.\nOther important characteristics of learning nursing include conceptual wisdom and skill development. You go on the identical quest repeatedly. A student can't utilize course withdrawal to prevent academic dishonesty penalties."

Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has bdelivered their souls from hell?\n7 Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the abands of death, and the bchains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.\n9 And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the achains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did bsing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.\n10 And now I ask of you on what conditions are they asaved? Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?\n11 Behold, I can tell you—did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the amouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?\n12 And according to his faith there was a mighty achange wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.\n13 And behold, he apreached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their btrust in the true and cliving God. And behold, they were faithful until the dend; therefore they were saved.\n14 And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye aspiritually been bborn of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty cchange in your hearts?\n15 Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who acreated you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption braised in incorruption, to stand before God to be cjudged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?\n16 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye ablessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?\n17 Or do ye aimagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and bsay—Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the earth—and that he will save you?\n18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect aremembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?\n19 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, having the aimage of God engraven upon your countenances?\n20 I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded yourselves to become asubjects to the devil?\n21 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be asaved; for there can no man be saved except his bgarments are washed white; yea, his garments must be cpurified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.\n22 And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with ablood and all manner of bfilthiness? Behold, what will these things testify against you?\n23 Behold will they not atestify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that ye are bguilty of all manner of wickedness?\n24 Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with aAbraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?\n26 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a achange of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the bsong of redeeming love, I would ask, ccan ye feel so now?\n27 Have ye walked, keeping yourselves ablameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently bhumble?

I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare bquickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.\n30 And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a amock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?\n31 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the atime is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!\n32 Yea, even wo unto all ye aworkers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it!\n33 Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto aall men, for the barms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.\n36 For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever abringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.\n37 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are apuffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone bastray, as csheep having no dshepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath ecalled after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not fhearken unto his voice!\n38 Behold, I say unto you, that the good ashepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not bhearken unto the voice of the cgood shepherd, to the dname by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.\n39 And now if ye are not the asheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the bdevil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a cliar and a dchild of the devil.\n40 For I say unto you that whatsoever is agood cometh from God, and whatsoever is bevil cometh from the devil.\n41 Therefore, if a man bringeth forth agood works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a bchild of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.\n42 And whosoever doeth this must receive his awages of him; therefore, for his bwages he receiveth cdeath, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.\n43 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in the aenergy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God.\n44 For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the aholy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.\n45 And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I aknow of these things myself? Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?\n46 Behold, I say unto you they are made aknown unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have bfasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of crevelation which is in me.\n49 And now I say unto you that this is the aorder after which I am called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must repent and be bborn again.\n50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his aglory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion. Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith: Behold the glory of the bKing of all the earth; and also the King of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of men.\n51 And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a mighty voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people—Repent, for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the akingdom of bheaven.\n52 And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the aax is laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be bhewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire. Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.\n53 And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and atrample the Holy One under your feet; yea, can ye be bpuffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing of ccostly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of the world, upon your driches?\n55 Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the apoor, and the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?\n58 For the names of the righteous shall be written in the abook of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.\n59 For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a wolf enter his aflock doth he not drive him out? Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.\n61 And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of ahim who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.\n62 I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the atree of life."

        "text": "Occasional diarrhea is a common occurrence. Most people will experience an episode of diarrhea at least once or twice a year that will disappear in a couple of days.\nLuckily, there are many foods to eat that may help a person reduce the symptoms of diarrhea. There are also some foods to avoid when dealing with a bout of diarrhea, and some additional home care tips to consider.\nAnyone who is experiencing persistent diarrhea should see a doctor, as a person may become dehydrated over time.\nDiarrhea is a bowel movement that is more liquid than solid or has a loose texture. It is a common problem and may occur a couple of times each year. Diarrhea will usually last no more than 3 days.\nSoft, bland foods, such as toast, will help to absorb excess water and ease the symptoms of diarrhea.\nPeople with chronic digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn's disease, may experience diarrhea more regularly.\nA person's diet is crucial if they are experiencing diarrhea. Some foods might help relieve symptoms of diarrhea while eating other foods can make diarrhea worse.\nWhile recovering from diarrhea, a person should eat bland, simple foods that are easy to digest and will help absorb some water from the stool.\nThese foods may be especially helpful on the first day of dealing with diarrhea. Eating many small meals throughout the day can help keep the digestive system from becoming overworked.\nProbiotic foods, such as yogurt and kefir, may help in some cases, but in others, probiotics may irritate the digestive system even more.\nProbiotics aid digestion by improving the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. However, dairy products can irritate the digestive system, so a person may wish to try non-dairy sources of probiotics, such as miso or sauerkraut.\nLiquids are also vital to recovery. People with diarrhea must drink plenty of water throughout the day and should drink an additional cup of water after every loose bowel movement.\nDrinking plenty of water helps prevent dehydration and flush any toxins out of the body.\nSoup broth will help to replace minerals and electrolytes lost because of diarrhea.\nSpicy ingredients can act as irritants in the digestive system. This is why people dealing with diarrhea should stick to bland foods, as they pose the least risk of agitating the digestive system.\nIt is not advisable to eat foods high in fat or oil when recovering from diarrhea. Added fats and oils from frying can be difficult for the sensitive digestive system to process and will likely make symptoms worse.\nA person can try eating boiled or steam vegetables and lean proteins instead.\nSugars that pass into the colon may disrupt the already sensitive bacteria there, making diarrhea worse. This includes fruit juices and high-sugar fruits.\nPeople with diarrhea should also avoid artificial sweeteners, as some can have a laxative effect.\nIt may also help to avoid too much fiber. Fiber helps keep the digestive system active. Usually, this is a good thing, but when the body is trying to recover from diarrhea, fiber may make symptoms worse.\nSoluble fibers, such as the pectin found in apples and bananas, can actually help a person recover from diarrhea, but a person should still try to limit their intake at least for the first day of symptoms.\nMany people experience diarrhea after drinking alcohol. Furthermore, some types of alcohol can be more likely to cause diarrhea than others. Learn more.\nCarbonated or fizzy drinks should be avoided, as they can irritate the digestive system and make the symptoms of diarrhea worse.\nCaffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and soda, may overstimulate the digestive system and make symptoms worse.\nCarbonated drinks may also irritate or contribute to other symptoms, such as bloating and cramps. People should also avoid alcohol while dealing with diarrhea.\nWhile many sports drinks contain electrolytes that may help with dehydration, they often contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Coconut water or electrolyte-enhanced water are good alternatives.\nIn addition to following a diet that will help relieve diarrhea, there are several other remedies a person can take to make a swift recovery.\nOther diarrhea treatments include bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) and Ioperamide (Imodium). These drugs can help relieve occasional cases of diarrhea and may be helpful to have on hand in a medicine cupboard.\nPepto Bismol and Imodium are available for purchase over-the-counter or online.\nPeople with diarrhea should also ensure they get enough rest, as putting the body in stressful situations while dealing with diarrhea may make matters worse.\nLimit physical activity while diarrhea symptoms are presenting, as strenuous activity may put the body at a greater risk of dehydration.\nHydration is also vital when managing diarrhea. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\nClick here to learn more about treating diarrhea.\nBlood or mucus may appear in the stool in more serious cases of diarrhea. This is often accompanied by a fever and requires a visit to the doctor as soon as possible.\nUntreated diarrhea can also lead to serious complications, including dehydration. A person with severe diarrhea may require hospitalization and intravenous electrolytes.\nAnyone experiencing a fever of higher than 102°F or severe abdominal pains should visit a doctor.\nParents or guardians should carefully monitor any children with diarrhea. If symptoms do not clear up with 24 hours, they should call the doctor for guidance.\nAny additional symptoms should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment.\nMany cases of diarrhea last only a few days and respond well to home treatments. Eating a simple diet, increasing fluid intake, and using over-the-counter medications as necessary can help reduce symptoms quickly.\nIn cases where the body does not respond to these treatments after 2 or 3 days, a person should visit their doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\nJohnson, Jon. \"What foods to eat if you have diarrhea.\" Medical News Today.

        "text": "Version 1.0 of the antenna switch didn't work as planned. The beverage antennas acted more like ominis and didn't help during the contests at all. After careful measurements by W4AD and W4RM, we concluded the old relay board layout wasn't providing enough isolation between ports. Two years later - we have version 2.0. The system was installed November 21, 2009 during the ARRL SSB Sweepstakes contest. John, W4NF, reports that the beverages seem to be working well.\nThe final design is based on relays from COTO (2204) and a circuit board with good RF layout principles. The isolation was measured to be in the order of 65db between the antenna port and radio port. Much better than the 30db we achieved with version 1.0! We added some external coax relays to provide further isolation and to ground the antennas when they aren't in use. (Lightning protection.) Provisions for external splitters were made, which should isolate the receivers when the antennas are shared between stations.\nI spent about 80 hours on the second design. Laying out the circuit board (gEDA) took most of the time. After initially laying out a single board, I decided to use a more modular approach. Again, thanks to generous junk boxes (WA0DYJ) and some good finds at Dayton Hamvention, the project cost about $200. Most of that was for the PC Board expenditure ($100), which I would do again - contrary to my claim in the write up for version 1.0.\nVersion 1 used standard 12V DPDT relays from Allied Control and the board was a kludge of trace cutting and rewiring. We thought it wouldn't have been a big deal at HF frequencies. We were wrong! After we discovered the isolation between antenna and radio ports was in the order of 30db, we disconnected the switch and used the old patch cord system.\nI started looking for a better switching element and spent a lot of time looking at PIN diodes, FETs and coaxial relays. PIN diodes are meant for VHF and up. They won't work well at HF. I never found a FET based design I liked. So I concentrated on relays. At first, we thought about using external coax relays, but nixed that idea when we realized it was going to take a 4x8 foot plywood board as a mount and multiple power supplies.\nI measured the isolation of several relays. The results are listed here. The Allied Control relay provided the least amount of isolation. (40db at 7MHz) The gold standard appeared to be a Dow Key RF antenna relay, which provided about 65db at 7MHz. After measuring several relays purchased from Mouser and Digikey, I found that it was important to use relay with a coax shield. So the search was on for something better than $4/ea since the project required 30 of them.\nLuckily, All Electronics had the right COTO relays for $1 a piece. The COTO 2402 has a coax shield to provide better RF perfomance. I found they were almost as good as the Dow Key relay at HF.\nVersion 2.0 incoorporates provisions for external RF splitters, which allows us to share antennas. This significantly complicated the switch logic and limited the various antenna/radio combinations. There are four radios (stations 1 through 4) and we have the logic set up so that Stations 1 and 2 can share with station 3 and 4, with only two radios connected at a time. When a second radio wants to share an antenna, an external splitter is switched into line. Although this provides a 3db drop in signal strength, it ensures the receivers don't feed additional noise into the shared receiver.\nAfter a few practical tests, we're not 100% sure this is required. I'll provide an update after the ARRL 160M contest. Note - we were going to build a few splitters based on an Internet article I found, but we decided to buy them from DX Engineering.\nI used Linux and gEDA to develop the circuit boards. This was a very time consuming process because I had to make several of my own parts/footprints to match the physical layout.\nThe auto-router function wasn't much help because it doesn't lay out traces according to good RF practices. I decided to use the top of the board for the RF traces and the bottom for the signals. The RF side has a ground plane on the top and bottom. The RF ground is separate from the signal ground.\ngEDA provides utilities to produce the gerber plots, including the drill instructions. I didn't modify any of the drill sizes in the file. The PCB board shops either provide a wide variety of sizes or round up as necessary. In some cases, I had to create a new part in the PCB layout package, which required careful measurements with a micrometer. I used the closest standard drill size,leaving a few thousands of an inch for extra clearance.\nThe circuit boards were made by PCFABEXPRESS. They did an excellent job. The soldermask and silkscreen layers were standard. Next time, I'll take better advantage of the silkscreen layer. Cost was about $120 with shipping, using the 10 business day option. (Doesn't include shipping time.) The boards were 2.5 x 5 inches and used two layers with platted through holes. Minimum clearance is 5 mils, which I took advantage of in some of the areas.\nThe code is fairly straight forward. The only quirks involve the bit mappings for the port state variables. I had to change the bit order to match the physical layout. Bit 3 is Station 2, for example.\nIn general, I keep the state of the relays for each board in an array. When the user request and antenna, I check for allowed combinations, set the new new state and then set the switch matrix with a strobe routine. The Micrel latches are addressed like memory chips. That is, I put the data on the parallel 8 bit input bus, which connects to all 6 boards. Then I strobe the right address pin for the desired board. The latches sink the appropriate relays and hold them in that state until a change.\nThe six circuit boards were mounted in a box made from PC Board material. Note the lower opening for the edge terminal connectors, which are used to connect the external coax relays. There is a missing SMA connector, which I'll add next time I buy something from Digikey or Mouser.\nThe switch, external relays, splitters and band pass filters are mounted on a sheet of plywood. The plywood is mounted to a wall near the contest station.\nNote: some of these pictures reside on the Picasa/Google site.\nVersion 2.0 - The new system.\nSwitch Module - There are six of these modules in the system. One for each antenna.\nCircuit Board - Close up of the board. Used gEDA default holes and clearances.\nInterface Board - Connects the remotes to the main controller board.\nInstalled- Antennas at the top and the band pass filters at the bottom.\nW4RM Contest Station - Three operating positions ready to go.\nRemotes before labels - Four remote controllers, before the lables were added."

        "text": "We Never Asked For Wings is a novel about one family who are struggling through everyday life. Mum, Letty, and children Alex and Luna, are doing fine until Maria Elena (Letty’s mother) decides to go to Mexico with Letty’s father and leave them on their own. Up until that point, Letty had delegated their upbringing to Maria Elena, and now finds herself in an unfamiliar situation. She must raise her kids alone. Knowing Luna’s father will never come back, Letty often wonders if she will ever see Alex’s father again, the man she was so in love with, but knew the news of a son would ruin the life he had planned for himself. Taking everything one step at a time, Letty faces the reality of bringing up her children alone, while trying to earn enough money to give them a better life. She soon realises that it may all be too much, and constantly wonders if she will ever manage to do a good enough job to give Alex and Luna everything they need to succeed. Firstly, the title. THE TITLE. Honestly, I think it’s one of my favourites ever, it implies so much about the weight thrust upon people who never asked for it, and who cannot cope under the pressure. Letty is the epitome of the title and, while I do have some minor qualms about her, she certainly acted as a good representation of those who feel they don’t know how to handle everything life has thrown their way. Not only this, but I think Letty was good proof that sometimes we let the fear of failure get in the way of us ever really trying. She was always too afraid of failing as a mother that she gave the responsibility to someone else, so she would never have to worry about not being enough. But in doing so, she rescinded her role as mother and therefore never felt its benefits. My main qualm with the novel was the consistency with Letty’s competency; the novel begins with her worrying about looking after her children and her inability to carry out simple tasks such as cooking, but as the novel progresses, we see her perform a lot of skills not possible for someone who was apparently useless. I do like Letty, and I thought her character was perhaps one of the most relatable, but I did feel that the author couldn’t decide just how incapable at being a mother she really was. On a positive note, I really enjoyed Alex’s relationship with Yesina. I think partly because it was nice to see Alex develop outside of his family, but also because the two of them, while maybe still blatantly being children, encouraged each other and looked after each other in a very mature way. It was wholesome, and beautiful, and reassuring. Also, little Luna was a lovely ray of sunshine and Diffenbaugh certainly wrote a convincing young child. Overall, We Never Asked for Wings is a compelling and relatable narrative of an ordinary family, just doing their best. Diffenbaugh does a fantastic job of proving how the ordinary can become extraordinary and I think her writing is stunning and powerful – I would definitely pick up another book by her. I always enjoy novels about ordinary people and their ordinary lives, but this novel in particular does a splendid job of showing that it is the strength you find in other people, that can give you the strength to thrive."

        "text": "Rochester Webelos Cub Scouts were lucky to be able to participate in maple syrup making in Rochester, MA last month. Our neighbor, Wendy Keeler invited us over to watch the process. She taps red maples rather than sugar maples since that is what is available in our area. The maple syrup has a great taste, a little more vanilla flavor, than traditional syrup from sugar maples. She had 11 tapped trees on her property and the cold nights and relatively warm days provided overflowing jugs of sap. The boys watched as she boiled the sap from the trees outside over a arch system fire. The boiling releases a lot of steam so boiling outside is preferable. The boys were surprised to learn that it takes 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup. It also takes 24 hours to boil the thin sap into a thick syrup. We got a taste of the finished product and it was delicious.\nWe also brought a 5 gallon bucket of sap home, thanks to Wendy, and boiled it down to one mason jar worth of syrup. It took 24 hours but it was worth every minute. The syrup was delicious. We are definitely rationing it to make it last as long as possible. It’s a lot of work but the finished product is so sweet.\nI really enjoy working with the Cub Scouts to learn new experiences. I also enjoy working with my clients in real estate to help them buy or sell their property. Please call me with your real estate needs. I would be glad to help!\nThis entry was posted in Bold Moves Real Estate, Carolyn MacGregor, cub scouts, MA Real Estate, MA Rochester Real Estate, Rochester and tagged Bold Moves Real Estate, Carolyn MacGregor, Cub scouts, family farms, gardening, MA Real Estate, the family farm.

I have drank so much coffee in June it's been so unhealthy for me but I've needed to as I've got insomnia at the moment (more on that coming up in a blog post soon).\nThey are pasteurised iced coffee with cocoa and is made with freshly-roasted, rainforest alliance certified beans, with fresh swiss milk. The caffeine content is 80mg per cup side of 230ml cup.\nYou can buy these awesome Emmi Caffe Latte Cappuccino Coffee Drinks from Tesco stores for only £1."

        "text": "If we are permitted to be Christians, this has its profound meaning and purpose and springs from God's eternal thoughts about us (Jeremiah 31:3). God has drawn us to Him out of pure goodness, compassion and mercy. We are now earnestly requested to humbly approach this incomprehensible Creator, as a people permitted to belong to God. We are not at eye-level height with the Almighty, but only those pardoned who still do not conceive the depth of this concept. We have no cause to think that we can approach God in any other manner, but in humility and respectful fear of God. God is not our mate. Who can fathom HIM? If we approach God with this Biblically-desired attitude, then God will reveal Himself to us and gladly have to do with us. And beyond that, He will also supply our living needs. To this it is written in Matthew 6:33 ''But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.'' God's righteousness is His grace, revealed to the world through Jesus Christ. God became human because no-one out of his own asked for God. The grace always comes from above, not from below! The Kingdom of God came to us – and many have twisted it around and haughtily mocked everything which was holy and precious to God. This is still true today. But, if we have faith, then this applies especially to us: Humble yourself before the LORD and HE will lift you up! In Jude 20-21 we read: “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.” God is Light and Life (Ephesians 5:8) and God is indeed that which humans are not, in comparison they appear merely as a “baffled wind” (Psalm 78:39) – HE on the other hand is: Meek and humble of heart (Matthew 11:29). Amen.\nNext devotion: Are you coming to the party?"

However, check in was late at around 2pm despite official check in time at 12pm. Breakfast was served late despite indicated at 9am. Breakfast was not ready at 10am and we decided to go out and eat.\nin general this place had value for the money spent. cozy room with great view of the ocean and surrounding islands. decent breakfast of yogurt with honey, egg, pastries, and eggs accompanied by decent coffee/juice. if you are looking for \"luxury\" however, this place is not for you, it more to enjoy the view and clean comfortable place to sleep.\nThe rooms are small and fairly old and there are no facilities of any note. The staff are friendly and the location is great.\nThe hotel was a big disappointment. It started with the terrace (which looked very nice in the pictures) being totally neglected with furniture thrown over etc. Also the whole hotel smells of stale smoke and the rooms, especially the ones at the top, are shabby and not too clean.\nSantorini is expensive, but this place was certainly the cheapest we could find. The rooftop terrace is the best part, the sunsets from here are great. The morning breakfast was also very good. The only thing we didn't like was the jacuzzi, it didn't look clean and also we read we had free airport transfers but she made us pay 10 EUR per person to use this service. Overall though, you are in a great location and can walk to anywhere.\nWe stay at the room with balcony. The view is superb.. Maria is very helpful and nice to us. The breakfast is perfectly served too. I don't mind to come back and stay at the same place when i go to Santorini in the future..\nNice location on the caldera. Very nice view of the sea not much view of the caldera. But best place to see the sunset from the roof top.\nGood location to see cliff & fair price for the room. Difficult to find the location of apartment.\nI would like to say \"Thank you, Maria\"!!! Best staff at Kafieris Apts, best view to Imerovigli & Fira.\nBreakfast was AWESOME!!! Staff was friendly and location is alright as you can just park your car up front. Shower is small and the bathroom is smelly tho. Overall we had a good time at Kafieris.\nThe location, price, view, and service were excellent!\nI spent my birthday at this hotel and it was amazing. The view from roof in the morning and at sunset was unbelievable! It overlooks Skaros rock and the Agios Theodori church is right next door. Would definitely stay here again!"

        "text": "Last weekend I spoke to many hypothyroid and hyperthyroid people at a Health Expo in Rockingham. A huge hello to anyone reading who attended. It was lovely talking to each and every one of you.\nWhen I talk to a stranger about being hypothyroid, I usually ask “Is it caused by Hashimoto’s”? I am constantly amazed and alarmed at the staggering number of people who either look at me blankly because they do not know what it is or just say “oh, I don’t know”. This right here is what I desperately want to change. Don’t get me wrong, you are not alone! I myself did not know either until I began my studies and a lecturer asked me that very question.\nWe all should know exactly what our illnesses are, what they are doing to our bodies, what our risk factors are for more serious disease because of it and if we can help ourselves in any way to fix it.\nDoctor’s only need to know if you are hypothyroid.\nSo what is Hashimoto’s? It is the autoimmune version of Hypothyroidism and 90% of Hypothyroidism is caused by Hashimoto’s. That is a massive percentage of cases don’t you think? Now, the reason most people do not know what their individual case is caused by is because our doctors will not treat you any differently no matter what the cause. They only have one thing to help us – thyroxine. So because our doctors are also bound by hierarchy and bosses who get on their backs about running too many tests at Medicare’s expense, they don’t run the antibody test.\nHowever, from a natural perspective, it is really important to know if your Hypothyroidism is caused by autoimmune disease, because that basically means your body is attacking itself. If you do not find ways to mitigate this ongoing attack, it leaves you open to other autoimmune diseases naturally creeping in. Common ones with thyroid sufferers are Celiac Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Type II Diabetes, all of which bring their own burden to the body you call home.\nAutoimmune Disease is essentially an immune system that is hyperactive and does not know how to turn off. It thinks it is doing the right thing by you, but has become confused as to what the enemies are and what the allies are. Our job is to stroke our immune system’s soul and help it to calm down and remember the friends and the foe.\nSome things you can do to help autoimmune disease include avoiding gluten, dairy and soy plus any foods you have an intolerance to, making sure 50% of each meal is raw, meditating and increasing your gut health (your army of good bacteria).\nSo, the next time I ask you “Is it Hashimoto’s”? I can’t wait to see the certainty from each of you that you know exactly what has caused your hypothyroidism."

        "text": "Record low and negative interest rates in developed economies are fueling a ravenous search for yield that is forcing pension funds and other conservative institutional investors out of their comfort zones and into risky emerging markets, according to fund managers and analysts.\nThe reason for this has little to do with the attractiveness of EM investments. On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees a diversification into EM debt by pension and insurance companies. \"We are seeing a broader group of investors looking at the emerging market debt asset class, including some insurers and pension funds that have not looked before.\"\nMuch of this search for yield takes place behind the scenes, but it is not restricted to developed markets, where an estimated $1.7 trillion in bonds were offering negative yields last month. South Korea's state-run National Pension Service (NPS) announced this week that it would pour more than $40 billion into overseas equities and bonds over the next five years.\nThe NPS, which manages $483 billion and is the biggest investor in the Seoul market, had \"no choice\" but to look abroad for returns, according to the Korea Times, because domestic interest rates are low and set to fall further.\nPaolo Batori, global head of EM fixed income strategy at Morgan Stanley, foresees a fundamental shift in market dynamics. He said about 5 percent, or $80 billion, invested by insurance companies and pension funds in European government bonds would be switched into EM fixed income. Such an increase would roughly double the current exposure of such companies to emerging markets.\nMr. Batori uses the experience of Japanese life insurance companies after Japanese government bond yields declined in the aftermath of the financial crisis to reinforce his forecast. From the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of last year, Japanese life insurance companies increased their investments in foreign assets from just over 15 trillion yen to nearly 35 trillion yen as their search for yield intensified.\nBut where in EM should yield refugees from Europe go? In one sense, there is plenty of potential; emerging market countries account for around 40 percent of global GDP but only 14 percent of the global government bond market by value. And differences in yield are stark.\n\"In aggregate, (local currency emerging market debt) yields 6.5 percent — just above the average for the last five years, and a full 1.25 percentage points above the level preceding the May 2013 taper tantrum,\" said Denise Prime, an investment manager at GAM.\n\"With former safe havens looking so unappealing, local-currency emerging market debt is an attractive option for fixed-income investors,\" she added.\nBut, of course, yields such as these do not come without risk. One of the biggest concerns is that when the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy — though the timing for this is uncertain — funds could exit EM assets in favor of enhanced returns in the U.S.\nThe most vulnerable EM countries in such a scenario would be those that run hefty current account deficits and are therefore reliant on external financing. Such risks have been so well telegraphed that fund managers generally pursue a highly selective approach to EM assets.\nOne of the strategies deployed by investors to mitigate the risks of a strong dollar is to fund investments not by borrowing U.S. dollars but euro, which has depreciated or stayed steady against many EM currencies. In 2014, local EM currency bonds returned an average 7 percent against the euro and have returned 7.3 percent this year so far, according to Ms. Prime.\nIn a separate category, a large but relatively untapped opportunity lies in China. Some $1.5 trillion of the $4 trillion global market for EM local currency bonds is located within China's domestic market, accessible to foreign investors only through a tightly controlled quota system.\nBut for those investors able to access allocations, the returns can be attractive because of the higher interest rate environment in mainland China. The China Universal Enhanced Bond Fund, for example, returned 13.12 percent in 2014, according to China Universal, a Chinese asset manager.\n\"We are definitely seeing increasing interest from European investors, both retail and institutional, who are hunting for yield in a world that is not really delivering their return targets,\" said Christopher Gunns, a managing director at China Universal.\nBut, he notes that Chinese domestic debt stretches the comfort zone for some European investors. \"Among the institutional investors there are two things at play; a conservative risk budget competing with a need to generate returns.\""

        "text": "I made this card some time ago and I wasn't sure if I wanted to upload it or not. I'm not that crazy about how it turned out, but it took me so long to make I just couldn't throw it away. I originally made this card for my daughter to send to her cousin who just happens to love frogs.\nMy cloud background was created using a punched scallop circle and a blue inked sponge. I simple sponged around the scalloped part and then moving the scallop circle I sponged again.\nMy grassy area was also sponged using old olive ink. I simply inked up the sponge and randomly sponged all over the lower part of my card base (I didn't use the punched scallop circle for this part).\nJust about everything else was stamped, cut out, and then I placed it onto my card. The cutting was the most time consuming part of my card. I stamped the flies directly on my card and then I stamped and cut out another fly. I placed the cut out fly right on top of the one that I had stamped on my card base (except for the wings). I left them unattached to my card base so that I could pick up the wings a bit. Then I placed some DD glitter onto each of the fly's wings.\nThe lily pad was stamped twice, but I cut off the cattails on one of the images. I used my chocolate chip marker to color in the two cattails. The logs were just stamped and cut out as well as the frogs. The sentiment reads- time's fun when you're having flies.\nThanks for stopping by! I'll be posting a CAS Christmas card tomorrow, have a wonderful day!\nOh Patty,I Can't see where you went wrong on this card.I love it.The scenery is soooo cute.Very creative.\nThis is darling Patty. What a great little scene you created.\nThis is SO fun and perfect! I love the little frogs leaping around trying to catch flies. I love how you created 3D glittery wings for the flies! Beautiful sponging on the grass and sky, too!"

        "text": "In my experience, it works well to think with the end in mind. What I mean is, picture in your mind’s eye, what would the end result look like in a perfect world? Write that down. Circle it if you would like to keep focus on it. Now, we need to work backwards from that. We also need to consider if there are other stakeholders that need to be involved to make the process viable based on the bare bones concept being considered.\nNow we are ready to think workflow, but did you know there’s a difference between a workflow and a process? A workflow is part of a process, sure, but not always a complete process. It is a common mistake to assume that a workflow is a process and a process is a workflow. A workflow is the modeling of the process.\nTo begin, we need to know what we’re starting and ending with and fill in the gaps in the middle with what little details we need to have happen. Visio is the tool that I adore for all things flowchart. Did you know that each little shape actually holds a different meaning? For example, the oval signifies the beginning and the end, the diamond is a decision point, and the rectangle represents a process.\nOne thing that I have learned in my many years working in project coordination is that it is never too early to start creating the flowchart, and it is never too late to revise it. Taking care to ensure that all of the key players are reflected correctly is important to do along with the tasks.\nEven though the modern version of workflows can be traced back to the 1800s, with my own workflows, I can be creative with colors, fonts, and backgrounds to let my personality show through a tiny bit, but they still tell the story of what is happening, when, and with whom. In the end, workflows are just that simple—who, what, and when. Without those pertinent pieces, what would be the point?\nA well-written workflow is a masterpiece of shapes, a symphony of lines, or a beautiful work of art in its entirety. There are many ways to sit and contemplate a complex process, but the easiest way is in a big poufy bean bag chair. I’m kidding—it is to draw it out on paper. Draw arrows. Erase arrows. Consider your team and the players involved. Change colors and fonts. It’s okay—just tell your co-workers that it is part of your creative process!\nDo you think you can streamline your tasks to make them faster? I challenge you to sit down and create a workflow for what you are working on right now. What can be automated? What detracts from what you’re working towards? This is how to define your roadblocks and how to solve to overcome them.\nJeannie Black is the Adjunct Services and Credentialing Coordinator at Franklin University. She has worn many hats over her career with a few Fortune 50 companies. She has a Bachelor of Arts in Communication, a Master of Business Administration specializing in project management, and a few Lean Six Sigma certifications. Jeannie is currently working towards a Doctor of Business Administration specializing in Project Management degree and Project Management Professional Certification.\nI'm always comforted when a manager or supervisor provides a workflow for a project I am working on. It's assuring to see your own piece of the workflow and how it connects with the project overall. It's also a great way, at a glance, to see all moving parts in one convenient location, especially when things (inevitably) move around. Great post!\nGreat post, Jeannie! I enjoy your upbeat attitude and creative outlook on workflows. I'm looking forward to trying out some of your tips and techniques, and I'll keep you posted on how it goes!\nBefore arriving at Franklin University, Jeannie wore many hats – editor, data analyst, and project coordinator to name a few, but the love of being a student persists."

        "text": "When the wind picks up and batters the trees that seem to swallow our little home, the leaves cascade on our roof by the cart load. With more wind, most of them blow away but the ones that block the gutters are the ones that let the water into the roof when the rain falls. From there the water makes its way via a natural slope of corrosion to a small drilled hole right above my bed in the bedroom where a baby mobile used to hang on a hook in a previous life. And then when I get anointed on the forehead with the drip drip drip of the holy water in the middle of the night, it is time to do two things. First, wake Nick up so we can push the bed out of the trickling waterworks and second, nag him to get up on the roof and get rid of the damn leaves.\nAfter we moved to this house almost a decade ago, I developed an irrational fear of trees falling on roofs and leaky ceilings. We live in the bush, surrounded by national parks on three sides. Tall looming trees are part of the territory. Now that I have seen the house bare-boned during the renovation, the fear of falling trees causing havoc is receding. The house seems strong enough to withstand a tree. And I have gotten so used to the rude splashes of water from my ceiling on my face a couple of times a year, that it is no longer exciting.\nThis over sharing of information is courtesy of the rain beating on my roof as I make a batch of these delicious-ly spicy and more-ish roasted cashews. As I watch the rain pouring down, I know Nick hasn’t been on the roof to clear out the leaves. I also know we have been pro-active and already moved the bed last night in anticipation of the drip drip. Boo ya soddy leaves! You won’t get me this time.\nThese roasted cashews remind me of monsoon in Mumbai. When the heavens would open up and it would pour, street carts would pop up with fire charred corn, roasted water chestnuts and spicy nuts. There is something guttural (no pun intended) about wanting to roast something on an open fire and chow down on when it is wet and gloomy. These cashew nuts are a siss-ied up urban version of the proverbial fire roasted snack. They are roasted in an oven but every bit as delicious as they were meant to be. Healthy too with a boost of chia seeds and the mighty turmeric.\nA delicious, quick and nourishing snacking option for your lunchbox. Also works as salad or soup topper. Roasted with the goodness of turmeric and chia.\nPlace cashew nuts in a large bowl with all the other ingredients. Toss to mix well.\nSpread nuts evenly on a rimmed baking tray and place in oven. Bake the cashew nuts at 140C for 10 minutes. Remove, toss nuts around and spread evenly. Bake for another 10 minutes until a shade darker and starting to turn golden.\nRemove from oven. Cool completely and store in an air tight jar for up to two weeks.\nOptional – Soak cashew nuts in cold water for an hour. Drain. Then mix them with all ingredients and bake ion oven. This will produce a less crunchy result but the nuts will be easier to digest and gentler on your stomach.\nThis looks so delicious Sneh!!\nThe story of your ‘drip drip’ adventures or these turmeric laden cashews – can’t decide which one I love more!\nI love this idea! I always think of sweetening up nuts so giving them a savoury twist is a top tip.\nA wonderful idea and combination! Great party food.\nI was given the biggest bag of chia recently and I have been searching for tasty recipes to use them in….so I’ll be sure to make these yummy nuts this weekend.\nlove roasted cashews..this is a beautiful version of it rather than plain salted. thanks for sharing this.\nOh this look perfect for salads to add a bit of crunch! NO wonder they are so moreish!\nCashews are my favorite, what a tasty snack!\nGrowing up in the Philippines, there were superstitious beliefs that ogres lived in big trees and it ‘s a place where dwarfs scheming their horrible plans. So I was pretty scared about big trees, thank goodness I overcame it, since now we are living where we are close to a state park surrounding our home. And being close to these type of nature is such a blessing.\nThis cashew recipe looks easy to make and the pictures make it want to grab it.\nI’ve never had a leaky roof but we did have an air conditioner (brand new) that leaked on my head for weeks until they figured it out. I wouldn’t have minded so much if I’d had these gorgeous cashews to eat while it dripped.\nA wonderful combination. Love cashewws but never thought of combining chia in roasted cashews. I would love these on salads.\nI seriously can’t wait to make a batch. These look to die for (and that color!!).\nYou’ve found a way to make cashews even better! Remarkable recipe.\nSo many super foods in one place!! I love a turmeric + cashew combo.\nThere’s nothing more ‘morish’ than roasted seasoned nuts really is there? These look delicious, I’ll be making a batch soon!\nBrilliant idea! Really! Can’t wait to try this!\nWhat a perfect combination of ingredients on hand! I am always looking for new snacks-thanks!!\nA delicious treat! Thank you for the recipe. One question: How do you get the seasoning to stay on the nuts after they’ve cooled? Everything (except the yellow turmeric color lol) was at the bottom of the container by the next day when I made my first batch. I just dumped it on top of a salad, but I’d like it to stay on the nuts.\nThese are crazy delicious! That tumeric and salt-laced coating… I have yellow stained fingers from licking out the bowl!\nA new favourite for snacking and gift giving. Thanks!"

This study presents results of DME partial oxidation over a 1.5 wt% Pt/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst under the condition of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15000-60000 ml/(g·h), molar ratio of O2/DME of 0.5 and 500-700 °C, and this temperature range was also the operation temperature range for intermediate temperature SOFC. The results indicated that the catalyst showed good activity for the selective partial oxidation of DME to H2/syngas. Under the working conditions investigated, DME was completely converted. Increase in reaction temperature enhanced the amount of syngas, but lowered the H2/CO ratio and yield of methane; while increase in reaction GHSV resulted in only slight variation in the distribution of products. The good catalytic activity of Pt supported on Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 for the partial oxidation of DME may be directly associated with the good oxygen storage capacity of the support, which is worth of further investigation to develop materials for application in SOFC. © 2008 CAS/DICP.\nChen, Y. and Shao, Z. and Xu, N. 2008.

If you’ve got one in your area go and make friends with them, they’re friendly, knowledgeable folk and love to talk running!\nSo cool even the graffiti kids want a piece!\nA surprisingly big turnout filled the store at 6pm and manager Pete got to work distributing headtorches and giving instructions on how to use them. “Push the button to turn it on, push it again to turn it off”.\nJust a few samples needed then.\nJaffas and gel shots, the perfect combination!\nOnce everyone had mastered this tricky technique we stepped outside for a quick pavement based warm up and we were off.\nPavement lunges can get you funny looks!\nThe route was just over 5 miles and managed to string together some of the unlit parts of town including Pittville Park and the famous Cheltenham Racecourse. I’ve always been a fan of the social run, and surrounded by nearly all new faces it was nice to have a chat with new running friends, and the unusual nature of the run gave us something to talk about straight away. We must have looked quite spectacular, a string of bright lights bobbing along the pavements or through the park, and people certainly saw us coming. In fact we bumped in to a lot of runners last night, quite literally, some who were wearing all black in the dark. It made me realise how important wearing something visible is and the headtorches really helped with that, so not only are they useful for seeing but also being seen!\nYou’re not going to miss this lot running at you!\nThe Ranger WL was the top of the range stocked by U&R (£25). At a bright 125 lumens for the main beam it gave a bright spot on the path ahead, but that isn’t always ideal. In a strange configuration you can have the main beam on full, half, or you can have the side lights on separately at only 18 lumens…but not all together! The result is a very focused beam with poor peripheral light, which I found distracting as your eyes naturally focus on the spot in front of you making for tunnel vision! I also noted a flicker in the beam every time I made contact with the ground, whether this was just the torch I had or is present in all of them I found it very distracting and not like the pure light I’ve come to expect from headtorches. Maybe not ideal for trail running but this headtorch will certainly light the path directly in front of your feet and help you be seen in the dark.\nThe distracting spotlight was an issue for me, but maybe not for others.\nThe Hunter XL25 is actually the bottom of the range option at only £10, but for pavement running I found it an improvement on the Ranger. The light is not as bright at only 25 lumens, but it is even and illuminates the bits that streetlights miss. The wide spread of the light gives a greater confidence when sidestepping puddles too. I still wouldn’t recommend it for trail running, but for a town centre pavement plodder at a tenner you can’t go wrong.\nThere is a mid-range torch, the Guide XL60, which unfortunately I wasn’t able to try but looks like it could be the best of both worlds at only £16. I’d definitely recommend looking at one if you are after a head torch.\nAfter the run it was all back to the shop where Pete handed out U&R buffs to everyone, perfect to mop my sweaty brow with! I had another jaffa cake and ran home without a headtorch, wishing I’d thought to bring one with me!\nThis entry was posted in Kit, Running and tagged Cheltenham, night run, running, shop, torch, Up & Running.

Unfortunately, he has little help from the screenplay, which turns repetitive and boring in the second half.\nWith two suitors for his daughter’s hand, the President announces that the person who comes out alive after staying at the haunted house for seven days will marry his daughter.\nBoth Sathya and Veera are terrified of ghosts but agree to the condition.\nDo they get out alive or are they too killed by the ghosts of Jackson and Durai (Sathyaraj), who have been battling it out for over 100 years in the old mansion, forms the rest of the story.\nThe film has its share of hilarious moments, especially in the first half with Yogi Babu totally in his elements, cracking the funniest dialogues with an absolutely straight face.\nThe scary parts can be described better as weird and wacky, but after the entertaining first half, the film soon shifts to sentiments and patriotism.\nSathyaraj appears only in the second half and there is a brief and unremarkable flashback, taking us back to the British period and the atrocities of Colonel Jackson.\nCinematographer Yuvraj creates the perfect ambiance for this horror comedy and the background score by composer Siddharth Vipin is just as impressive.\nInterestingly, the romantic angle has been ignored and there is not much for Bindhu Madhavi to do, except look pretty.\nSibiraj is adequate and Sathyaraj’s performance is monotonous. Karunakaran is whole lot of fun, but Yogi Babu undoubtedly steals the show.\nThe film starts of well but lags in the second half and the screenplay begins to go downhill.\nHowever, there is a certain wackiness to the narrative and the absurd characters that make director Dharanidharan’s Jackson Durai a tolerable watch."

        "text": "Every business owner or manager has tons of projects they need to complete. This is where it pays to have some knowledge of project management to ensure everything falls into place. Poor project planning can cost you: sometimes in the form of thousands of dollars, sometimes just in time and headaches, which can be just as bad. Get some examples of how poor project planning can cost you, and some tips on getting it right the first time.\nI often try to implement new processes or procedures in my car dealership based on customer or employee input. One of the processes I wanted to improve upon was the time it took for service customers to bring their cars in for service, communication on needed repairs, and an easy pick up when the vehicle was ready. Seems simple right? Well it wasn’t!\nFirst off, I gathered the opinions and concerns from both employees and customers. I created a timeline of the way things were currently being done along with the suggestions on how to improve the entire process. I was sure my new process would be streamlined and keep the customers and my employees happy.\nOnce my service manager and I created the written policy, we reviewed it with our service employees. Even though we had obtained all of our service employees’ input, one employee noted, “What if the service manager is not available to take a customer’s telephone call?\"\nYes, that “what if\" did indeed occur! Upon this realization, suggestions were thrown at me and before I knew it, I had six different ideas on how this could be handled—some good and some ineffective. At this point, I tried to implement an unnecessary element into my new service process—after all, the service manager does go out to lunch! It didn’t work out well because I tried to force a solvable element into a process that really didn’t need this element!\nHence, my service manager and I went back to the drawing board to figure out the solution to this problem which could have been avoided if I would have analyzed my project in more detail. In essence, this service solution project failed and, until redeveloped, both my customers and my employees were affected.\nAnother real-life example of poor project planning is the introduction of the Chrysler PT Cruiser. While the Chrysler Corporation had the design, production, and advertising right on key, they didn’t consider dealer showroom delivery times into the project equation.\nWhile top heads at Chrysler production plants fought about how to deal with this, they also received nasty phone calls from dealership owners who had their own ideas. The solution (an added, non-planned-for element) was to just ship out cars to any old rails in any old city and let the dealers figure it all out—this, of course, did not work, revealing the importance of a good project plan.\nDeciding upon the best idea on delivery times and ensuring the much anticipated public turned the delivery of wanted PT Cruisers into a real-time nightmare. Dealers lost deposits and customers purchased cars from other automakers.\nIf product delivery schedules would have been included in the project scope, this debacle would have never happened. Avoiding the analysis of the delivery times harmed Chrysler’s initial sales of the PT Cruiser.\nVision & Mission – Every project must possess a good vision and mission that is clear, concise, and understood by everyone involved in the project.\nWork Breakdown Structures (WBS) – A good WBS, if well written and reviewed, can determine just about every element of a project including items from initiation to testing to completion to delivery to market, as well as the project tasks that need to be completed.\nUser Stories – Although an Agile Management Methodology, user stories offered by clients, stakeholders and end-users can make a world of difference in determining every element of the project at hand.\nMilestones – You should create milestones within the project that can be reviewed when complete and compare the outcomes to your WBS and user stories. Don’t proceed if milestones aren’t clear or effective.\nIterations – Used in Six Sigma, iteration planning is often very effective. Once an individual team completes its iteration sprint, if it’s not right, it goes back.\nCritical Path – Use a critical path method to find acceptable levels of project goals and milestones as well as those that are not acceptable or above or below the critical line of the chart.\nScheduling – Stick with a good scheduling plan and review it often to address concerns.\nStatus Meetings – You must employ regular status meetings to keep up to date with what every member of your team is doing. Make these mandatory.\nCommunication – Without an effective communication plan that is accessible to everyone, issues are bound to come up that you did not think of.\nIf you look back at your career, you can probably identify at least one project where unplanned obstacles derailed your goals. Use these steps to avoid problems, and if need be, run with a project scenario first to see what’s not included, what shouldn’t be included, and how best to fix the wanted or unwanted project elements."

        "text": "Dino Marcou provides a scout report which analyses Greece’s latest defensive starlet, Panagiotis Retsos.\nPanagiotis Retsos falls into the list of defensive rocks that top domestic teams in Greece have impressively produced over recent years. At the tender age of 19, the solid, intelligent defender has already played twice for his country, impressive in this day and age for a defender. Retsos, being born in South Africa, was eligible to represent Greece through his familial heritage, and made his senior international debut on 31st August 2017 in a 2018 World Cup qualifier against Estonia in Pireaus. Retsos became the youngest captain of a Greek title winner aged only 18, an achievement that will take many years to be beaten. He is a young footballer with pretty much the world at his feet.\nPanagiotis Retsos was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to Greek parents and took his initial steps in football at Greek giants Olympiakos, playing for their youth side between 2008 to 2016. The Greek international was then promoted from Olympiakos’ youth team by manager Victor Sanchez and notably turned professional in 2016. Sanchez was impressed with a number of his credentials, most notably his stamina and great composure on the ball.\nRetsos ultimately attracted the interest of many European clubs. Olympiakos did not want to sell their prized assets at first, resisting offers at first. But Retsos was eventually sold to German giants Bayer Leverkusen, who had to fight off interest from French clubs Olympique Lyon and Stade Rennais in the process. He is a versatile centre half, despite playing mainly as a central defender at Olympiakos, and can play across the backline as well as in defensive midfield. That versatility would make him an attractive option for the manager he is working under. Standing at 1.85 metres tall (6 ft 1″), his height is an attractive characteristic that he has at his disposal and allows him to be a threat in the air. He would be good at dealing with set piece situations whether it be carrying out his defensive duties or going up for a set piece in an attacking situation. That being said, his versatility will be an asset for Bayer Leverkusen and his country in his overall development as he rises up the ladder in the game.\nRetsos’s breakthrough to stardom for Olympiakos came when the young defender showed enormous qualities in his leadership skills, so much so that he was appointed captain of the club in a Greek Cup match. Aside from his effective leadership, a skill that can be seen as a dying breed, it was impressive for a young player to show such great leadership at a young age whilst also being very consistent in his defensive duties. In Greece, playing away from home can be very intimidating, especially against bitter city rivals Panathinaikos and AEK Athens, and it was a great confidence booster for Retsos, who has only increasingly grown into his role over time.\nPanagiotis Retsos can be likened to AS Roma’s centre back and fellow Greek Kostas Manolas, and can follow in his successful footsteps that he has had in his career so far. He is a tall defender and reads situations very well; he is quick and often cuts out the situation before it arises. His aforementioned versatility makes him a versatile option. The Greek teenager has maturity, composure and calmness way beyond his tender years, and is way ahead of his time.\nBayer Leverkusen are a club that like to play out from the back, and this can benefit Retsos. He shows tremendous composure on the ball and can start attacks and play out from the back effectively well. The young defender never shies away from a challenge and is often positively aggressive and effective in a 1v1 situation and does not let many players get past him. Retsos carries out his work very professionally and can be a future leader of the Greek national team. Ever since their shock Euro 2004 triumph, they have not had a good stable squad, which is why they have come up short and lack the quality needed to stay on track with bigger countries. Standing at 6’1″ and only being 19, Retsos has the potential to grow even more in height, and with his height being a great advantage, he can head the ball well and can be effective when going up for a set piece for his side.\nIn an attacking sense, Retsos is collectively sound and specialises in many attacking departments. He is effective in the air and would cause many teams problems aerially. At his previous side Olympiakos the set-piece deliverer would often try to find him as they knew he would be a danger. Despite his young age, Retsos possesses a great deal of composure and calmness on the ball, whilst relying on his natural game-reading intelligence to get him through the match. Retsos is a level-headed player and does not show any aggression that could cause a major hindrance for his overall development in the game.\nThe problem with defenders in the modern game is that they are so often taught by coaches to play out from the back, so much so that the true art of natural old school defending goes out of the window. This could be said with Retsos, as despite his great ball playing composure on the ball, he should release the ball quicker, in case he gets caught out from the attackers. He may get away with it in the Greek League but in the Bundesliga, you cannot be so predictable otherwise you will get found out by better attackers, which would lead to lesser gametime and ultimately the stagnation of his progression and development. If Retsos wants to develop his game, he will need to stay consistent and learn from his more experienced team mates. Young players in the game do not have the desire to learn and believe that they know it all, so in this sense he needs to learn more and this will only come with experience.\nIt is very natural that a player will need a lot of time to adjust to the demands of playing in a different country, the lifestyle and style of football under a new coach. However, Retsos has climbed the footballing ladder tremendously well since his rise to the first team at Olympiakos, which therefore suggests he is here for the long term and can have a very successful career in Germany and potentially elsewhere. He will no doubt look to continue his great rise in the game so far and will look to be the player that Bayer Leverkusen builds around for the future. Olympiakos opened the door for this opportunity to happen as they truly knew that he was unique and it would be the perfect chance for the Greek to play his trade abroad. He could go on to be one of Europe’s best defenders in the future."

This cleverly titled ebook can help with all the mishaps and beautification situations ladies find themselves in and provides quick tips to a quick fix. With helpful advice on how to revive shattered powered to how to look your very best on a budget, this book covers all bases when it comes to most frequently asked makeup questions.\nWhether you’re a makeup enthusiast or just getting started, ‘I’m Not Making This Up’ is an ebook for you, and I’m definitely not making that up.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on February 10, 2014 by natalia.\nLips are gorgeous! Nothing says love and joy like a smile or kiss! Here are some of my favourite tips for a perfect pout. Enjoy!\nTo keep lips in perfection condition, apply lip balm before bed. I actually have a toothbrush just for this purpose. After brushing teeth, use the extra toothbrush to slough off any dry skin. Apply balm. Lips will feel like new by morning.\nI love the lip balm by Burt’s Bees. It is all natural and comes in a variety of formulations.\nLip Liner is great to enlarge lips or make them more symmetrical. Just remember to use a neutral hue or one that matches lipstick or gloss. The dreaded look that I call “Oreo Mouth” (dark liner and light lipstick) is over. For added lasting power, apply to your whole lip before applying lipstick or gloss.\nI love the Outlast Lipliner by Cover Girl. The colours, texture, price as well as lasting power can’t be beat!\nTo prevent lipstick from bleeding, apply powder with a q-tip just outside the lip line. It really works!\nI love Hello Flawless by Benefit. It comes in a variety of colours. This powder is so unique that you can use it dry and dust all over, or layer it on using your finger, and it works as a concealer. Great stuff!\nLip Stain is great for lasting results. I also love that you can layer it on – from sheer to opaque tones. I love the lip stain by Benefit called Benetint. It can also be used on cheeks for a 2 in 1. For best results, make sure skin is well exfoliated and moisturized. Apply stain with fingers (the warmth helps it blend) to the apples of cheeks and to lips. Using a circular, upward motion, blend well. Make sure to wash hands well after.\nClinique’s Almost Lipstick is one of my favourite products on the market. It is extremely hydrating and the colour is unique to your natural lip colour. Apply a coat for a sheer result or layer on for more of a vibrant hue.\nBest Tip: Make a lipstick palette by scooping out the remnants of your lipstick from the tube. Using a clear medicine container, place remainder of lipsticks in each section. Melt in the microwave for about 30 seconds. This tip is great for mixing your lipsticks as well. Hello new hues! The clear container is perfect as you can see the colours. You can also label each section if you like.\nCarry covered straws in your purse. I love the covered ones at Starbucks, McDonald’s or Tim Horton’s as they are hygienic. Drinking with a straw helps lipstick last much longer.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on February 1, 2014 by natalia.\nNatalia Zurawska has been a professional makeup/hair/spfx artist for the last 10 years. If you would like to see more of her work, visit her website at www.colourchameleon.com. Natalia has recently come out with a makeup e-book entitled “I’m Not Making This Up. It features all of the best makeup beauty tips and tricks that she has learned over the years to save you time and money. It is available on Amazon (http://astore.amazon.com/wwwcolourcham-20) as well as Smashwords (https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/379111).\nSpring is coming up and beauty products should not be ignored. Here are some great tips to keep all your makeup and hair supplies in great order as well as some great tips to save you money.\n1. When in doubt, throw it out. If it smells funny, the texture is off or you haven’t used it in a year, chances are you mostly likely won’t. Make a pile for makeup you rarely use and throw the rest out.\n2. Have a makeup and hair product trade party with your friends. Not only does it feel great to get rid of product, you will get product that you will use. Win-Win for all.\n3. Spray all eye shadows, and powder makeup with alcohol min 70%. Powder makeup stays intact for ages. I like to spray my powders, eye shadows and blushes every few months and clean the containers frequently. This is also a great tip if any of your powders break. Simply spray the rubbing alcohol, create a paste and leave open to dry. It will be back together!\nBest tips – if you have remnants of bronzer and powder, you can create a highlight/contour in one by crushing the powders and placing each (on either side) in a compact container. Spray with alcohol and make a paste. Allow to dry.\n4. Wash makeup brushes weekly. I wash my brushes after every use for hygiene purposes. If it is only you using them, once a week is great. Use a mild shampoo or dish detergent. I also like to use conditioner. The Tresemme Naturals collection cleans so well, smells great as well as moisturizes without any reside. Rinse well and shape. Lay flat to dry so the water doesn’t run into the glue of the handle and loosen it.I love the brushes by Cover FX. The foundation brush is especially fantastic. The bristles are very dense in amount, soft and blend so well. The result is flawless.\nThere are many ways you can store your brushes. Here are just a few cute ways. Use colored sands or silica gel to match the décor of your room.\n5. Use a tail comb such as the one by Goody – www.goody.com to clean scraggly hair out of hair brushes weekly. Wash hairbrushes with shampoo and allow to dry.\nCleaning hair tools is easy by using alcohol wipes while the irons are hot. Swipe the alcohol wipe through a few times to get rid of any product residue.\n7. Organize makeup and hair tools. This order works well for me. Top shelf has cotton pads (I cut them in half for double the uses), q-tips, and face wash, moisturizer. Second shelf is foundation, concealer, eye shadows, blush, mascara, powder and lipsticks/glosses. The bottom shelf is medication, toothbrush and toothpaste, floss.Hair items tend to be bigger and heavier hence I like to place them at the bottom. Hair products come next and last hair tools.Keep makeup and hair tools in a cool, dry place.\n8. Regardless of how much you want to spend and how big your space is, here are some great options. Baskets also work well.\nIkea, Walmart and Target are all great places to find great stuff."

Atticus Finch is an educated, highly intellectual man who works for the state. “Atticus met [Scout and Jem’s mother] when he was first elected to the state legislature.” (7) We know he has formal schooling because you must be educated to be elected to most offices. Atticus is hard working, and his job helps the community therefore they value him, whereas the town often comment on how they haven't seen the Ewell’s do one honest day of work. Bob Ewell is an ignorant drunk who has eight kids and no job. His intellectual capacity is nowhere near that of Atticus Finch’s. Judge Taylor is forced to read the riot act to the spectators in the courtroom following Bob Ewell's accusation and “The judge cautioned Bob, too, but Mr. Ewell reminded [Scout] of a deaf-mute. [She] was sure he had never heard the words that Judge Taylor directed at him.” (233) Bob Ewell can’t comprehend half of what people say to him and isn’t very intelligent. Because of this contrast in intellectual capacity, Atticus and Bob are on very different levels of understanding, which is sure to create conflict sooner or later.\nDialogue Essays: Do Vampires Really Exist?\nThe Day of the Sale...

        "text": "By Bill Gallagher of Portland, Oregon. For 25 years, Bill Gallagher has been a fixture in Portland radio, including seven years as the host of the top-rated \"Bill Gallagher Show\" on KXL. Until last month, he was the news director at KPAM. Previously, Bill contributed \"Home on the Range...\"\nI'm getting almost emotional as I read the arguments for and against Ballot Measure 56 in the Voter's Pamphlet.\nThis must be how a combat veteran feels seeing the same wars being fought over and over again.\nI never lost my temper, but I got pretty hot when the topic was the unique-to-Oregon, vote-suppressing, process-perverting, indolence-rewarding, so-called Super Majority.\nFor anyone who's not down with how it works, sit up and blink twice. Here we go: In order to pass measures on the ballot that will raise taxes it's not enough that a majority of voters vote yes. No, MORE THAN a majority of the registered voters have to actually vote.\nSo a measure could pass but fail. You could get a majority of the votes but with a turn out below 50% you're screwed.\nDon and Bill cooked up this Super Majority scheme because they got tired of seeing public service money measures passed in March and September. They couldn't get out the NO vote so they figured out a way the naysayers could get their way: By NOT VOTING. That way they could sink the spending measures and take their ball and go home.\nBallot Measure 56 is supported by virtually every organization that has a stake in getting these money measures passed. Why not? One small fire district saw its levy defeated because just seven voters didn't vote.\nAnd here's a dirty little secret: There are lots of voters registered to vote who will never vote. They've moved away or died. But they DO vote because they're still registered. So the number of actual voters is artifically high. And that means you have to get 50% plus one of an unreal number of voters.\nRegistrars and County Clerks say they purge these non-existent voters regularly. To which I would say, after watching several ballots arrive for a brother-in-law living with me long after he'd moved away, YEAH, RIGHT!\nI'll concede that some public service spending measures have been slipped onto a low-turnout election ballot. But the solution to that isn't the Super Majority .50 caliber machine gun. The solution is the fly swatter that is MEASURE 56. VOTE YES.\nI'd recommend that if you're only going to vote on one ballot measure that you make it YES ON 56. But there are WAY too many other good ones on this ballot.\nBill, glad to see that you're staying engaged, and sharing your thoughts here. Good explanation of the supermajority.\nIt was Phil Keisling who eradicated the lingering doubts I had about the supermajority a year or two ago. He pointed out that a referendum on ANY subject is potentially important, and creating a special class for only revenue measures is entirely arbitrary. If there are concerns about turnout and voter awareness, they are better addressed in other ways. In fact, limiting elections to only four times a year has already been accomplished.\nMeasure 56 doesn't really go far enough, because it will still be impossible to pass a revenue measure during ANY election in an odd-numbered year...but it's a strong step in the right direction. Maybe with a strong enough \"yes\" vote, the legislature will feel empowered to remove more of the supermajority requirement. Hey, I can dream, can't I?\nI'll concede that some public service spending measures have been slipped onto a low-turnout election ballot.\nIn this era of vote-by-mail, there's NO SUCH THING as a low-turnout election. Everyone gets a ballot in every election, and there's no longer any such thing as slipping a tax measure past the voters unnoticed. You can vote \"yes,\" \"no\" or you can \"abstain\" by withholding your ballot, but you pretty much can't avoid \"turning out\" to vote. Not voting is simply your way of showing up and saying \"I don't care\".\nBill, most people's wages do not grow as fast as government expansion! I do not get a 20% raise a year - do you?\nMost people these days are getting by on less - maybe you media libs aren't but alot of other people are.\nSimply put: we can not give government the opportunity to continue to grow at %20+ a year. If you want bigger government - send in more $$ to the government, but don't force me to.\nDan -- So, just vote NO on the measures. But you should have to vote NO to say no.\nOtherwise, you're letting dead people and people who've moved away make decisions for the rest of us -- seems I've been hearing lately that conservatives are opposed to that.\n\"...you should have to vote NO to say no.\"\nI'm SO hoping this measure passes. It's long past due.\nShould read \"some yahoo's NON vote\"\nA great example of why we need to keep the double majority. It is obvious West Linn did not want this levy passed. One has to wonder why the levy showed up again on the ballot immediately after Nov 2006.\nA good example of the \"goverment class's\" continued 'election shopping' until they get an election that they can win.\nFirst you lose when over 10,000 people show up and vote it down. So you come back at the voters in March and try again when you know that only 60% of the people who came out last time (but really only 41% of the registered voters will) actually show up. But you still fall short. So you come back again in May, begging for more money. Again, hoping that only the yes votes(*) show up to vote. When does it stop? When 10-20% of the voters get to tell the other 80-90% how much their taxes will have to increase.\nThat is not democracy. Keep the Double Majority. Taxes that are worth raising will pass a Nov election, if it has real support of the voters in the community.\n(*) Yes votes = people with a vested interest, ie feeding off the public trough.\n\"In May 2005, the Lower McKay Fire District had a levy fail due to double majority because 7 people did not vote.\"\nThis written on page 56 by Members of the Legislature no less. This looks to be an incorrect statement."

It is a case of whether we are viewing the glass as half empty or half full. In the first instance, \"lives saved\" is framed as a gain. People are instinctively risk averse2 with respect to gain and are reluctant to gamble with a sure gain unless the risky gain is so much higher. In the second instance, \"certain death\" is framed as a loss. People are instinctively risk seeking3 with respect to loss and are willing to gamble to reduce loss unless the risky loss is so much larger.\nIf people's perceptions of reality changes depending how reality is framed, the whole ideological foundation of consumer sovereignty and market exchanges as a positive-sum game is threatened. Then whoever wields the power to frame perceptions would gain at the expense of the passive perceivers. In the marketplace, this means consumers may be stuck with things they don’t really need at higher prices than they should. And in the political sphere, they may be duped into accepting policies that don’t serve their interests.\nThe expected value of a gamble is the average value of the payoffs weighted by their probabilities.\nThe tendency to choose a sure gain over a gamble with equal expected value.\nThe tendency to choose a gamble with an expected value equal to a sure loss.\nFrank, R.H.

However, in this frenzy over the major categories, one interesting slot that often gets eclipsed is the Academy Award for Best Animation Feature. Five movies are contesting for this top honour this year.\nDreamworks’ ‘Kung Fu Panda’ is back to fight it out for the coveted title. In its first bout in 2008, it lost to Pixar’s much-acclaimed Wall-E, but this time packaged with more action, more emotions and definitely more humour, the sequel seems to be a strong contender. It follows Po, the Dragon Warrior and his companions Furious Five’s struggle against Lord Shen, exiled heir of the Peacock clan who is back to conquer China and has a mysterious connection to Po’s past.\nShrek, Dreamworks’ much older franchise, is also in the race this time. However, due to the dying popularity of its main character, it is the side-kick ‘Puss in the Boots’ who’s got the lead in this spin-off prequel to the franchise. Antonio Banderas reprises his role as the Puss and is joined by various nursery rhyme and fairy tale characters, like Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill and Andy Beanstalk, on his adventures. However, the movie fails to impress much and one surely misses Shrek, Fiona and Donkey despite Salma Hayek joining the crew as Puss’s female companion Kitty Softpaws.\nAnother feline giving competition to Puss in this category is ‘A Cat in Paris’. This French production tells the story of a cat that is an adorable pet of a young girl by the day and accomplice of a burglar by the night. This otherwise little known movie with a run time of just over an hour, happens to be the most surprising nomination in this category.\nJohnny Depp also enters the race as a chameleon in Nickelodeon production ‘Rango’. The story follows this pet chameleon that accidently lands in a Wild West town struggling with shortage of water. Destiny makes it the sheriff of the town and despite some hilarious but serious blunders on the way, saves the day for the town folks. This clumsy chameleon will surely give the clumsy panda a tough competition.\nChico and Rita, another European contender, comes from Spain and Isle of Man. This ‘only for 15 and above’ production narrates the trials and tribulations of a young black Cuban pianist, Chico and his love interest Rita, a singer, both trying to make it big in the entertainment industry around the 1950’s. This story of love and betrayal is the only non-anthropomorphised movie in this category and with its slick animation, storyline and music, is potentially a dark horse in the race to the top.\nIndian fans just need to wait till the morning of February 27 to know who crosses the finishing line first and gets to hold the gold knight statuette– the panda, the chameleon, either of the cats, or the dark horse.\nFor the sake of your life, I couldn't leave without commenting!!"

In a country like India which has the second largest number of mobile phone users in the world, it is especially important to note the ill effects of our increasing dependence on smartphones. Technoference is making people unhealthy in many different ways. It wouldn t be wrong to say that most of us have become addicted to our mobile phones. Now, an Australian research published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry claims that excessive use of mobile phones is making people not just lose sleep but also become less productive. The study also noted that mobile phones are making us take more risks while driving and that they are causing more aches and pains. You could partially or completely blame the following health conditions on your excessive use of mobile phones: Eye problems: Doctors have noted an increase in eye conditions like presbyopia (age-related long-sightedness caused due loss of elasticity of the lens of the eye) even among their younger patients. Dry eyes syndrome, irritation and redness are some of the other common problems. It is worse to use your mobile phones in the dark as it strains your eyes even further. Infections: As shocking as it may sound, you could also blame skin infections like acne on your mobile phones. Your mobile phones carry a number of germs on them. This is especially true in the case of those who use their mobile phones in their toilet. The germs, oil and dirt on your phones could cause a number of infections when It coems in contact with your hands and face. Radiation-related problems: There have been conflicting reports on the effects of mobile phone radiation on health. There are ongoing research studies being carried out on the possible link between cancer and mobile phone use. According to the World Health Organisation, there is tissue heating which means that the energy radiated by the frequencies of mobile phones is absorbed by the skin and other superficial tissues which results in negligible temperature rise in the brain or any other organs of the body. It also says that to date, research does not suggest any consistent evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to radiofrequency fields at levels below those that cause tissue heating. The long-term effects, however, need more research because many cancers are not detectable until many years after the interactions that led to the tumour, and since mobile phones were not widely used until the early 1990s, epidemiological studies at present can only assess those cancers that become evident within shorter time periods, according to WHO."

This is not true, he said, noting world trade is expanding.\nRecently, the Wangs gave PLU $4 million to establish the Wang Center for International Programs, which will prepare students to be leaders in the global economy.\n- Support and strengthen the universitys array of internationally focused academic program.\n- Coordinate and advance PLUs nationally ranked foreign studies offerings.\n- Become a research institute for faculty and students exploring global issues.\n- Offer public education, including symposia and publication.\nI think Tacoma should be proud of PLU, because they had the foresight to move in that direction, Wang said, noting he chose the university because of the strength of its international programs, as well as his fond memories of the campus.\nThe Wang Center is being formally established for the 2002-2003 academic year, and the inaugural public symposium is scheduled to take place on April 9-12, 2003.\nAt the speechs conclusion, Udbye presented Wang with a World Trade Center Tacoma pin, which he affixed to his jacket lapel.\nThe World Trade Center Tacoma was established in 1979 when the Port of Tacoma purchased the license from the World Trade Center Association.\nIt is the primary regional resource for international trade information for the South Puget Sound region.\nThe World Trade Center Tacoma is committed to developing international trade in the greater Tacoma area and has over 120 members.\nThe World Trade Center Tacoma provides services such as trade leads, informational programs and hosting and network connections."

However this method is geared towards people that doesn't know this approach yet, So keep on reading to find out how I did it, and see if you knew the approach already! if you would like to skip the story reading and you want to TL;DR go to where it says in big red bold letters, [TUTORIAL], last but not least, Hope you enjoy it!\nSo I was working on a Themida protected DLL, and such DLL was getting hooked at runtime by the game Entrypoint (e.g. push <DLLName>; jmp &LoadLibraryA; If DLL was found -> Continue Exec. else Jmp to Exit) Alright till here everything was good... Now when I started digging in it, I saw that... when I attached x64dbg to the process, it was getting terminated! So I said.. probably the program is protected with something... So here's where it gets interesting... The game executable wasn't protected with anything! but that just one module... so I said.. pretty cool that a DLL detects if a debugger is being attached... probably by Themida's API Hooking and I kept on going thinking to myself what could be wrong... Not so long passed that I was getting aggravated with it, the impossibility to do something with the program really got me badly.\n0. CRITICAL STEP: Suspend your process at Startup! or after the troublesome Protected DLL loads!\nTo \"suspend\" a process after a specific DLL was loaded, I went and downloaded API Monitor, and went onto the API's and put a BP before DllMain call, that way when the offender DLL got called, the process was still being executed! the only difference is the DLL got loaded. It's one of my other \"Quick and Dirty ways\" of doing things Also since I'm working on x64DBG I used ScyllaHide to continue further progress... keep on reading to see how I executed everything.\n1. Download PC Hunter (attached below for your convenience ;D) and extract it somewhere comfortable.\n3. At the navigation tabs shown above, select \"Ring3 Hooks\".\n8. Now just Right click and select Restore All... or if you had problems and/or your process exited/terminated abruptly while restoring all, just be selective and try one by one, I know it can be tedious, but at least it works... Most of the times you will be able to \"Restore All\".\nGood, now we should have our process ready to continue loading... Now just remove all BP's at API Monitor (remember Step 0?) and resume execution... at this point your program should be running, normally.... Now Just go to x64DBG and in Plugins, go to ScyllaHide -> (remember to use Themida Preset) -> Attach to Process, and just use the little Pick Tool thingy, drag and drop it to your process and click attach!\nIf you followed up everything, you shall be at the DbgBreakIn on attach, just resume execution in x64DBG and viola! you have successfully bypassed the so Fearful, Themida's Anti-Attach!\nRohitab: for making API Monitor a great tool.\nXueTr: for making PC Hunter free.\nI wasn't aware PCHunter was still being developed?\nHi 0xNOP, yeah ... as you said, it's useful to find a way to make something work without changing your \"environment configuration\"\nSorry bro, can't help you there, Don't even know what you're asking for."

Data set for such analysis contained sequences from two orders (BLAST search showed affiliation with this two orders). Topology of trees tells that target strain may be a new species or may be insertae sedis.\nWhat kind of analysis should be performed in order to proof that target strain is a new species or may be insertae sedis or none of that?\nOne of the multi-gene trees for one of the orders is shown on picture."

        "text": "Not many real-estate brokers can sum up some of the best of what they’re selling in one word. Cindy Dube of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage’s New Homes Division is the exception. All she has to say is Lofts!\nFirst it was the Biscuit Lofts in a totally rehabilitated former factory building on Envelope Terrace, off Shrewsbury Street in Worcester. Only a few units remain available there. Now Dube has turned her focus to the Fremont Lofts a structure in the Webster Square neighborhood that has a history every bit as impressive as that of the Biscuit Lofts.\nThe Fremont Lofts will consist of ninety-seven loft-style condominiums on four floors, featuring a mix of one and two- bedroom layouts ranging in size from seven hundred eighty-eight to one thousand eight hundred ninety square feet. Amenities will include a fitness center, a media center, two roof decks and a courtyard. Storage space will be available for purchase as well.\nPrices start in the $ 140,000’s for the units. All of the units feature high ceilings: 9'7 on the first floor, 12'4 on the second and third floors, 13'9 on the fourth floor.\nLike the Biscuit Lofts, the Fremont Lofts involves a substantial reconstruction of an existing impressive edifice. The partners in the project boast top- notch credentials. One of them is the Abrams Group LLC, a Boston- based real-estate development firm that specializes in just this sort of work: turning vintage properties into reasonably priced residential communities. Recently, the Abrams Group turned a onetime manufacturing complex in Lowell into one hundred thirty-four loft-style apartments. The other partner is the Callahan Companies, a full- service, family-run construction firm that ranks among the largest in New England.\nIn 2002, the Boston Business Journal ranked The Callahan Companies fourteenth among the Top 25 construction companies in its coverage area. Endeavors in which The Callahan Companies have been involved include one hundred eighty apartments at Marina Bay in Quincy, the Club Atlantis condo hotel in Orlando, Florida, condos in Brookline and Whitman and schools, other hotels and retail stores.\nThe roots of the building in which The Fremont Lofts, at 160 Fremont Street (entrance access is from St. John’s Rd.), are housed, trace back to 1923 when the structure was built for a silk and rayon-weaving company. It later housed the Sweeper Vacuum Company. In 1951, the property was bought by the L. Farber Company, which made leather shoe components and more specifically welting (welting is the leather strip that joins together the shoe’s sole and the upper leather). Today, welting is only found in high-end footwear.\nDube, who exudes enthusiasm about how loft living is transforming the Worcester landscape, said The Fremont Lofts are already close to 20% sold, which is a fascinating phenomenon considering that we’re operating out of a sales trailer (next to the building), there’s no model unit yet for people to look at and the building is not ready. Dube expects units to be ready for occupancy by the end of 2005. The address will be prominently announced in capital letters on a brick tower in front: 160 FREMONT.\nShe also expects a strong response rivaling that generated by the Biscuit Lofts, from prospective customers. People from the Worcester area want lofts, she said, and also from Boston, where the price of housing is so astronomical. It doesn’t hurt, either, that Webster Square boasts a brand-new Price Chopper supermarket. That tells you something, when businesses like Price Chopper put a flagship store in, she said.\nContact Rod Lee with ideas for HomeSource stories; by telephone, 508-793-9213, or e-mail, rlee@telegrain.com."

        "text": "2005-10-21 Assigned to GIDYNAMICS, INC. reassignment GIDYNAMICS, INC. ASSIGNMENT OF ASSIGNORS INTEREST (SEE DOCUMENT FOR DETAILS). Assignors: MELANSON, DAVID A., LEVINE, ANDY H.\nA collapsible gastrointestinal anchor can be characterized in various embodiments by a radial force of about 0.1 Newtons (N) or greater at a compressed diameter of 25 millimeters (mm); by an average spring rate of about 13 Newtons/meter (N/m) or greater in a range of motion between a relaxed diameter and a compressive elastic deformation diameter; or by a radial force over the range of motion of about 0.1 N or greater. Typically, the anchor can be adapted to be retained within a subject's intestine, more typically in the duodenum, or particularly in the duodenal bulb just distal to the pylorus. A gastrointestinal implant device includes the collapsible gastrointestinal anchor and a floppy sleeve. The sleeve is open at both ends and adapted to extend into a subject's intestine, the anchor being coupled to a proximal portion of the sleeve. Also include are methods of implanting the gastrointestinal implant device in a subject, and methods of treating a subject for disease. The disclosed gastrointestinal invention leads to an improved ability to secure anchors and devices in the gastrointestinal tract while tending to minimize migration.\nFIG. 1C is a graph of force versus displacement data for various anchor devices during loading (compression). Table 1 (below) shows the results. These mesh and laser cut stents have been used as stents for esophageal tumors. Stents cut from Nitinol tubing (“Laser cut 1” and “Laser cut 2”) have a range of motion of about 0.45 inches (about 11 mm), and a maximum relaxed diameter of about 0.8 inches (about 20 mm). Another example, “Mesh stent” has a range of motion of about 0.3 inches (about 8 mm) and a maximum relaxed diameter of about 0.7 inches (about 18 mm). Made for esophageal tumors, these values are not sufficient to anchor the nominal relaxed interior diameter of the adult duodenum, which is about 25 mm, nor its normal range of motion, which is about 25 to 40 mm.\nWave anchors were presented by applicants for the purpose of anchoring a sleeve in the intestine. Two wave anchors (“Wave 0.014” and “Wave 0.016”) have ranges of motion of about 1 inch (about 25 mm) and relaxed diameters of about 1.5 inches (about 38 mm), and can thus begin to address the diameter and range of motion of the intestine. Their spring rates are 0.0438 pounds/inch and 0.0722 pounds/inch (about 7.7 N/m and 12.6 N/m, respectively) and the force exerted by each (during loading) at 1 inch (25 mm), the nominal relaxed diameter of the duodenum, is 0.05 pounds and 0.04 pounds (about 0.2 N/m and about 0.16 N/m, respectively). (Force measurements have been made in pounds force. Conversion to metric units includes pounds force*4.448=Newtons force; pounds force/inch*175.1=Newtons/meter; 1 inch=25.4 mm) Moreover, while there is at present no known upper limit for radial force and spring rate in the intestine, it is believed that these lower radial forces, lower spring rates, and longer ranges of motion of these wave springs can allow for more natural motion in the intestine compared with the anchors in the preceding paragraph. It is believed that allowing the anchor to follow the natural motion of the intestine may provide more secure anchoring, may allow for better digestive system function and may tend to avoid subject discomfort. Thus, these wave spring anchors are believed to be superior to the anchors in the preceding paragraph. However, in experiments it was noted that these anchors tended to migrate in the duodenum.\nMoreover, the anchor should be able to provide sufficient force over the range of motion of the intestine. In various examples (as will be explained in greater detail below for FIGS. 3A, 3B, and 4), it was determined that the nominal postoperative diameter tended to fall in a range where the loading radial force of the anchors at the top of the postoperative diameter range was between about 0.05 and about 0.1 pounds (from FIG. 3A and 3B; about 0.2N and about 0.4 N). It is believed that this radial force range at these diameters is thus associated in pigs with a long-term steady state expansion value. It is desirable to provide at least these forces over the range of motion, but not to exceed these forces at the expanded diameter to avoid over expansion of the gastrointestinal tract at the location of the anchor. Thus, in various embodiments, anchor 200 is characterized by a radial force over the range of motion of about 0.2 N or greater, more typically, about 0.3 N or greater, or particularly about 0.4 N or greater.\nIn various embodiments, anchor 200 can be characterized by an average spring rate over the range of motion. For example, in FIG. 2A, anchor 200 is compressed from a relaxed diameter 25 to a compressed diameter 26, and the radial restoring force 24 can be divided by the difference between relaxed diameter 25 and compressed diameter 26 to give a spring rate. Thus, for an anchor with a relaxed diameter of 60 mm and a force of 0.4 N at a compressed diameter of 25 mm can be calculated to have a spring rate of 0.4/(60-25)=13 N/m. Also, the average spring rate can also be calculated by recording compression force versus compression distance data and performing standard least squares analysis to obtain the average value of the force/distance slope, corresponding to the spring rate (N/m). Thus, in various embodiments, the anchor is characterized by an average spring rate of about 13 Newtons/meter (N/m) or greater in a range of motion, the range of motion being within a diameter range defined by a relaxed diameter and a compressive elastic deformation diameter. More particularly, the average value of the spring rate is between about 15 N/m and about 35 N/m.\nFIG. 3A shows curves during loading (compression)for two disclosed wave anchors having relaxed diameters of 50 mm. The lower curve has a radial force at 25 mm compression of about 0.1 pounds (about 0.4 N), a radial force at 40 mm of about 0.05 pounds (about 0.2 N), and a substantially linear spring rate of about 18.5 N/m over a range of motion of almost 35 mm. The upper curve has a radial force at 25 mm compression of about 0.2 pounds (about 0.8 N), a radial force at 45 mm of about 0.06 pounds (about 0.24 N), and a substantially linear spring rate of about 32 N/m over a range of motion of almost 35 mm. Another anchor (curve not shown) was constructed with a radial force at 25 mm compression of about 0.18 pounds (about 0.8 N) and other characteristics similar to the upper curve. Upon implantation into pigs, it was found that these 50 mm anchors were secure and did not migrate.\nIt can be seen in FIG. 4 that for the 50 mm and 60 mm anchors that were followed by X-ray, the nominal postoperative diameter tended to fall in a range where the radial force of the anchors at the top end of the respective ranges was between about 0.05 and about 0.1 pounds (from FIG. 3A and 3B; about 0.2N and about 0.4 N). For example, for the 50 mm anchors, the nominal postoperative diameter was about 30 to about 40 mm and the radial force of the anchors at 40 mm was between about 0.05 and about 0.1 pounds (from FIG. 3A; about 0.2N and about 0.4 N). For the 60 mm anchors, the nominal postoperative diameter was about 40 to about 50 mm and the radial force of the anchors at 50 mm was between about 0.05 and about 0.1 pounds (from FIG. 3B; about 0.2N and about 0.4 N). It is believed that this radial force range at these diameters is thus associated in pigs with a long-term steady state expansion value. It is desirable to not exceed these forces at the expanded diameter to avoid over expansion of the gastrointestinal tract at the location of the anchor.\nWithin the implant device 600 at the proximal end including the first proximal opening 606 is a collapsible self-expanding anchor 602 in the form of a stent (e.g., an embodiment of anchor 200 in FIG. 2A-2D). The anchor 602 can include a plurality of opposed barbs 608 for anchoring the implant device 600 to the muscular tissue of the duodenum 104. The diameter of the anchor 602 is dependent on the diameter of the duodenum 104 (FIG. 1) about 1.0″ to 2.5″ (about 25 mm to about 65 mm) based on human anatomy variations. In one embodiment, the length ‘l’ of the anchor 602 is selected to reside within the bulbous duodenum 119.\nFurther examples of methods and apparatus for implanting the anchors and devices of the invention, anti-bucking devices, methods of treatment, details of construction of the anchors, sleeves, impregnation of the sleeves with drugs for treatment of various conditions, and the like are provided in Meade et al U.S. Utility application Ser.

The most optimistic is a first round selection. Most likely, though, the call could come sometime during the second or third rounds.\nBaseball America has projected Deardorff, who graduated from South Lake High School Friday, as the 54th overall pick, which would make him a second round choice.\nDeardorff, though, isn't getting into guessing games about where, or even if, he is going to be taken.\n\"I have no idea,\" he said, about where he would be drafted. \"People have said a lot of things, but I don't want to say anything in case it doesn't happen.\"\nSouth Lake baseball coach Mike Crawford, though, thinks Deardorff will reach his long-time goal.\n\"His goal in life is to play pro ball,\" Crawford said. \"The team that gets him will be extremely fortunate.

He is a kid who not only can beat you with his bat, but with his speed and with his glove.\"\nDeardorff, who played third base for South Lake High School this year and was an outfielder before that, has been the object of desire by pro scouts this spring. Early this year, more than 20 scouts were showing up at games and practices to watch Deardorff's skill at the plate, his smooth fielding ability and his strong arm.\nDeardorff, who played for the U.S. Junior Olympic team last summer, finished this season with a .463 batting average, 8 home runs, 31 RBIs, 31 runs scored and 22 stolen bases.\nHe starred this weekend at the Florida Athletic Coaches Association's All-Star Games, and also has attended three or four workouts recently, including ones with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and New York Yankees.\nThe Montreal Expos, who have eight of the first 52 picks in the draft, also have shown a lot of interest as have the Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros, Chicago White Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\"I saw where he is being projected between the first and fifth rounds. That is great when you consider all the collegiate players like (FSU's) J.D. Drew are also in there. I think he is going to go reasonably high. I think he will definitely go before the fifth round,\" said Crawford.\nDeardorff, who is an early baseball signee with the University of Miami, is just thankful that the day finally has arrived.\n\"It's a little bit of a relief,\" he said. \"I can get all of this out of the way and go out and play for a job.\""

        "text": "I'm a noob when it comes to most financial history and it seems that I tend to get into a bit of a quandary when arguing with progressives. One such recent discussion involved the Savings and Loans crisis. I was young when this happened and have not done enough research, however, in this particular case, the indication was that deregulation caused the crisis. The Progressive(s) that I was discussing with were mentioning that it was deregulation that allowed the S&L's to take advantage of people, not tell them what they were buying, and generally be evil like all Capitalists.\nA quick view of the \"Moral Hazard\" listed out on Wikipedia site for the Savings and Loan Crisis indicates to me that the Savings and Loans were allowed the Federal financial protection of the banks (FDIC?) but not the regulations that the banks had. This tells me that it was not deregulation that caused this, but rather, Federal monetary protection against failure prompting them to grant poor loan choices.\n1. Am I way off in my deduction of the cause of this?\n2. Anyone recommend any good (reasonably unbiased) reading on American financial history that would be appropriate for a layman?\nI feel that as I grow toward Anarcho-Capitalist, I'll need a much more robust understanding so I'm not left without reasonable defense.\n1) Government promises to cover the deposits.\n3) Banks become too leveraged, and fail.\nIt's really a simple recipe, and you can use this same model to explain a lot of the crises around the world. Moral hazard, as you mentioned, fits in because it's the reason the banks want to take on so much leverage. They can take risks and know that someone has promised to bail them out. So they can win but never lose. Regulation is only \"good\" as a means of undoing the damage the government has caused with FDIC. So government messes up, tries to fix it with more government, and only partly undoes the damage, so we end up not too well off, and paying a lot for it. So yes, deregulation was the proximal cause, but the real question is why the banks had the incentives to take on so much risk in the absence of certain regulations. And the answer is government.\nMy impresion is that the S&Ls knew thay would be bailed out, which they were. Sorry canot help with the rest.\nRegulation (I.E. government policing and safety nets) only serve to make a business take unwise risks that it never would take if it did not have these \"regulations\".\nMarch, 1980--Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) enacted. The law is a Carter Administration initiative aimed at eliminating many of the distinctions among different types of depository institutions and ultimately removing interest rate ceiling on deposit accounts. Authority for federal S&Ls to make ADC (acquisition, development, construction) loans is expanded. Deposit insurance limit raised to $100,000 from $40,000. This last provision is added without debate.\nDecember, 1982--Garn - St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 enacted. This Reagan Administration initiative is designed to complete the process of giving expanded powers to federally chartered S&Ls and enables them to diversify their activities with the view of increasing profits. Major provisions include: elimination of deposit interest rate ceilings; elimination of the previous statutory limit on loan to value ratio; and expansion of the asset powers of federal S&Ls by permitting up to 40% of assets in commercial mortgages, up to 30% of assets in consumer loans, up to 10% of assets in commercial loans, and up to 10% of assets in commercial leases.\nParts of the 1986 Tax Act also contributed."

        "text": "How many KPIs are optimal to drive agency performance?\nThe concept of performance based remuneration or payment by results appears to me to be universally embraced. After all, according to the latest ANA Agency Compensation Trends Survey, 68% of marketers’ arrangements have a performance or results based payment component. The problem is that it is often poorly executed.\nBut I have noticed another reason that this often fails, and it is similar to point three (The calculation is way too complex or expensive) and that is because there are too many metrics in the measure.\nExamples include: sales, traffic, profit, market share, volume growth, etc. These can be measured by the same criteria that the advertiser uses for their internal bonus systems.\nThe Agency often claims that business results may not be within their ‘span of control’ as many factors besides advertising can affect business outcomes.\nExamples include: product awareness, ad awareness measures, consumer measures, attitude ratings, persuasion, purchase intent, awards, brand equity, image, effectiveness awards, etc.\nThis kind of performance assessment is vulnerable to research technique, statistical anomalies and discussions of creative ‘philosophy’.\nRelates to the evaluation of agency functional areas: account services, creative and media in terms of: performance, service, relationship, cost efficiencies, etc.\nThis is highly subjective and may be affected by ‘entertainment’ on the upside and personality problems on the downside.\nThe right metrics are more important than the number. So lets deal with this first.\nWhat are the right type of metrics?\n1. Developing a list of metrics available to you.\nWe had a client who proposed investing almost quarter of a million dollars a year to buy data on a quarterly basis to measure and pay a performance bonus of less than $200,000. Poor investment.\n2. Rank the order of importance of the metrics to the various stakeholders.\nNot all stakeholders across an organisation have the same objectives (which explains the misalignment and lack of collaboration). It is important to align metrics to the valuable stakeholder groups. CFOs and CEOs will generally focus on financial metrics, while marketers will have marketing metrics as well and so on. Understanding these alignments is crucial.\n3. Evaluate the level of influence the agency has on the metric.\nOf course no-one can control everything, but marketing is about influence. Therefore it is important to understand the metrics the agency can influence and by how much. We had a retail client who wanted to measure the agency against sales, but we pointed out that the agency had more influence on foot-traffic through their store, which correlated closely with sales.\n4. Plot the importance against the level of influence of the agency.\nCreate a matrix with key stakeholder importance against agency influence. At the bottom will be those metrics that are least important to the key stakeholder – lets say agency relationship performance and in the top the metric of most significance to the CEO being the profitability. Across the matrix on the left will be those metrics that the agency can directly influence, being the relationship with the client and on the right would be the metric they can least directly impact like profitability of the company. And all the rest are somewhere in between.\n5. Select the most appropriate metrics for the situation.\nThis is a balancing act. It is not valuable to choose metrics the agency cannot directly impact just as it is not valuable choosing metrics that are not significant to the key stakeholders. But you can look for those metrics that the agency can influence and also correlate with the more significant eg. Store foot traffic and retail sales or brand health and market share etc.\nThe agency ends up focusing on a multitude of metrics and actually influencing none at all.\nOr they focus only on the ones they can directly influence, gambling on the fact this will maximise their returns.\nThe relative size of the bonus paid for each metric diminishes with the number of metrics being measured and so the influence of the bonus is also diminished.\nThe more metrics, the more measuring, the greater the complexity and cost and the less likely to drive focus and effort.\nThe ideal number in my experience is a singular focus on the one most important metric that the agency can have some direct influence over. For those wanting a more diversified range of metrics, three is ideal, depending on the size of the performance bonus prize.\nThere are two main reasons this process fails. The first is due to the marketer or procurement making the performance models horribly complex by trying to make them a surgical tool in supplier management. Largely they fail because they do not acknowledge the bluntness of the tool.\nThe second is the agency trying to mitigate risk by adding as many metrics as possible. Adding more subjective metrics into the mix can ensure that unlike empirical metrics which will range from 0 to the highest level, subjective metrics are inclined to inhabit a narrow range, usually above the midpoint range.\nBut entering into a performance bonus to mitigate risk, mitigates the reason for the performance measure in the first place. It is like an athlete wanting to add other metrics such as beauty, intelligence and like-ability as factors in determining the results of Olympic 100 metres athletics competition.\nCritical to success is a significant carrot, a clear and focused metric or metrics, that the agency can influence, and is significant to the key stakeholders within the organisation.\nHow are your performance metrics looking? Are they relevant? Are they complex? Are they focused?"

With a continually reducing inventory of homes on the market and the interest rates still at an all time low, I believe we'll continue to see strong sales. This week, on the Nevada side of South Lake Tahoe, there were no foreclosures for sale and just one short sale! The rest of Nevada is still seeing enough foreclosures to keep them as the #2 state in the U.S. in the number of foreclosured homes but that isn't the case in Lake Tahoe.\nThere has been more activity on the higher end market of homes for sale. One estate just sold in Cave Rock for over $20,000,000 and another in Skyland for over $13,000,000. There is much more trust in the economy and it shows in these large purchases. Buyers are willing to pay for the kind of home they desire.\nThe higher priced homes are finally seeing increased sales, even though the above figures for the whole year saw a slight decline. Each month since June has seen an increasing number of home sales. January's sales in the $435,000 range were up 250% and in the highest range they were up 50%. In fact, the only range that saw a decrease in January was the lowest range which saw a drop off of 22.6%.\nSince most buyers are from outside of the Lake Tahoe area I heard a very common theme to questions: what is the neighborhood like? In order to better serve my clients I've just finished creating video reviews of all of the neighborhoods on the California side of South Lake Tahoe (Nevada is coming soon!). You can view them in three places: You Tube Channel , neighborhood description page and neighborhood video page . I have combined these neighborhoods with my other service of providing video Review/Previews homes for sale that you're interested in.\nMy two businesses of the month are both new places on the South Shore. They have a common name, but are separate and owned by different groups.\nis a new boutique hotel built with the active traveler in mind. They have 50 stylish rooms which are designed for adventure and relaxation seekers alike, with the amenities and style of a modern resort, but at more affordable motel or inn-like prices. I like the fact that each room is designed with a new touch - one room has a tent and \"campfire,\" while another has bunk beds to sleep 8. Each night they have a family style dinner club where they are all big tables and everyone eats as one big family. They also serve s'mores over an open fire on the rooftop deck afterwards.\nYou might have recently seen them on the Today Show, in Time magazine or the New York Times. They are located next to Harvey's Resort Casino.\nMy second business of the month is Basecamp Pizza. It is located across the skating rink from my office in the Heavenly Village. They aren't like your normal pizza parlor! Their full menu and full bar will satisfy all taste buds. They have soup, salad, wings, hummus and pita, pasta, pizza, desserts and a fun kid's menu. My favorite pizza is the Apple and Gorgonzola pizza - Apples, gorgonzola cheese and red onions are baked to perfection over garlic cream sauce. Finished with arugula, tossed in a hint of balsamic vinaigrette. Yum!\nThey have added daily outdoor music under heaters and it's been very popular with the after ski and board crowd. They have happy hours specials and you can also follow them on twitter and Facebook.\nIt is very popular and busy all of the time!\nI am continuing to offer the \"Dan's Preview Review\" service for my clients. If you find a Tahoe home for sale that you're interested in, contact me and I'll provide a video review with narration...it will be like you're there touring the house yourself! Many buyers are looking for a 2nd home and aren't in town to actually view it themselves. They are finding this service quite helpful in their search of real estate in South Lake Tahoe."

Those include contracts for C-17 and C-130 military transport aeroplanes, advanced trainer jets and the French Rafale fighter jet.\nThe advanced trainer jet contract with Alenia Aermacchi of Italy was expected to be announced at the Dubai Airshow in November but was postponed because of unresolved issues surrounding the production of parts in the UAE, Mr Kahwaji said. “There are a lot of technical issues that go into these contracts and they can get very complicated,” he said."

        "text": "Are E-cigarettes Leading More Kids to Smoke?\nToday, thanks to decades of educational efforts about the serious health consequences of inhaled tobacco, fewer young people than ever smoke cigarettes in the United States. So, it’s interesting that a growing of number of middle and high school kids are using e-cigarettes—electronic devices that vaporize flavored liquid that generally contains nicotine.\nE-cigarettes come with their own health risks, including lung inflammation, asthma, and respiratory infections. But their supporters argue that “vaping,” as it’s often called, might provide an option that would help young people steer clear of traditional cigarettes and the attendant future risks of lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, and other serious health conditions. Now, a new NIH-funded study finds that this is—pardon the pun—mostly a pipe dream.\nAnalyzing the self-reported smoking behaviors of thousands of schoolkids nationwide, researchers found no evidence that the availability of e-cigarettes has served to accelerate the decline in youth smoking. In fact, the researchers concluded the opposite: the popularity of e-cigarettes has led more kids—not fewer—to get hooked on nicotine, which meets all criteria for being an addictive substance."

After this period, fees will be returned only in exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the school management.\nStudents attending the school and those accommodated in the residence of the Divine Word Missionaries are asked to be respectful of the rules and ethos of the religious community.\nThe school management reserves the right, in the event of unsatisfactory conduct, to request a student to leave his/her course and, where accommodation has been arranged by the school, to vacate the relevant premises.\nThe school shall not be liable in the event of any service which it has contracted to supply, becoming impossible to provide by reason of industrial dispute or other cause outside its control.\nThe school will be liable for loss, damage or injury to persons only when such liability is expressly imposed by statute. Students are recommended to obtain travel insurance before leaving their home country. Students from countries in the EU or EEA should obtain a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in their own country prior to their departure.\nCourses of 25 weeks or longer for non-EU or EEA students with permission to work.\nAdditional terms and obligations apply to both the school and course participants in cases where a student has enrolled in one of the courses at the school which is on the Interim List compiled by the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS). Students on these programmes are from non-EU and non-EEA countries and are entitled to work while attending the school.\n1.Refunds: All fees (less €100 administration charge) will be returned to a student who cancels, provided that the school is notified in writing at least two weeks prior to commencement of his/her course. Once a programme has commenced, a refund will be made which is proportionate to the time remaining on the course (less €100 administration charge). A refund will be made within two weeks of a request being received. Where a non-EEA student who has a visa with permission to work requests a refund after a course has commenced, it will be necessary for the school to notify the local Garda National Immigration Bureau Unit (GNIB). The School Co-ordinator, Michael Fitzgerald, is responsible for making payment of refunds. He can be contacted in person at the school or at details listed above.\n2. Attendance and Punctuality: The student is to attend 15 hours of class each week between 08.45 and 13.00, Monday to Friday. Attendance is monitored on an ongoing basis and students are required to be present for a minimum of 85% of their programme. In particular, students should ensure that they have a high level of attendance on commencement of their stay at the school. Students who arrive ten minutes or later after a lesson has commenced, should not join their group until the next class; they will be registered as absent from the period for which they arrived late. Any student who leaves before a class has concluded will also be marked as absent. The school is required to bring concerns regarding poor attendance to the attention of a student. This is initially done with a verbal warning and, if there is no improvement, it is followed by a letter or email. Where tuition fees are paid by a sponsor / benefactor, those who have made the payment to the school are informed about a student’s poor attendance record.\n3. Expulsion: If it is considered by members of staff that a student’s behaviour is unacceptable or if his/her attendance record falls below the minimum required, he/she will be given a verbal warning and will be asked to nominate a classmate who will accompany him/her when the warning is given. There will also be two members of staff present. If there is no improvement in the student’s behaviour or attendance he/she will be requested in writing to leave the school immediately. Fees will be refunded in relation to the remaining course period (less a €100 administration charge). Where accommodation payments have been made in advance, these will also be refunded (less a payment of one week). The local GNIB Unit will be notified that the student is no longer permitted to attend the school.\n4. Sick Leave: Non-EEA students who have visas with permission to work are required to notify the school if they are absent due to illness. They should indicate if they require any assistance from the school. Notification should be sent to the School Co-ordinator by text to the school’s emergency number (087 2523467) or email address ( office@dwse.org ). A doctor’s certificate will be required for an absence of more than two consecutive days or four days in any month. If the school does not receive a letter from a state registered doctor, the student will be marked as absent. The local INIS officer will be notified if there is an extended period of absence due to illness and a medical certificate has not been provided.\n5. Holidays: The school is closed for up to three weeks over Christmas and New Year, two weeks at Easter, a week in June and a week in September. Non-EEA students who have a visa with permission to work should take holidays only during the periods allowed by INIS regulations. The letter from the school to the local GNIB Unit will, most usually, be for a period of 33 weeks (including 8 weeks of holidays); this increases to 35 weeks (including 10 weeks of holidays) if it incorporates the Christmas and New Year holiday. This agreement and the letter for the local Immigration Unit set out the periods during which holidays should be taken. Prior to signing, both the student and School Co-ordinator should agree and confirm that the timing and duration of holidays are correct. At no time should holidays exceed 1/3 of the total weeks elapsed of the student’s stay at the school. Most usually, outside of times when the school is closed, holidays are taken at the end of a course.\n6. School Tests and End-of-course External Examinations: The school arranges reviews at various times during a term and at the end of each semester. These are corrected by the school staff and returned to the students for evaluation. The results of these periodic tests are recorded by the school. It is necessary for students who have enrolled on ILEP courses to take an external examination on completion of their programme. These are: TIE A2; Cambridge B1Preliminary; Cambridge B2 First; Cambridge C2 Advanced and Cambridge IELTS.\nThe school is required to advise the student on the most appropriate examination which should be taken and ensure that he/she is registered accordingly. Please note that external examination charges are included in the course fee. It is the particular responsibility of the School’s Administrative Assistant, Matthew Doyle, office@dwse.org to provide details of examinations and enrolment requirements (registration closing dates, location of examination centres, etc.).

We see the Bankenviertel (banking district) on the left and in the centre the old town of Frankfurt (Altstadt). We do not see the pedestrian bridge Eiserner Steg which crosses the Main in the middle of this panorama and connects the Römerberg, the central market square, with the southern shore and the museums district. The reason is that this linear panorama was created from two seperate panoramas left and right of the bridge and those perspectives combined eliminated it. Both seperate panoramas are added in the adjoining detail images.\nThe banking district lies between the old town and the train station and is not only dominated by skyscrapers but also by construction sites. The dominating skyscrapers in this view are the Commerzbank Tower on the right, the highest building in Germany, and left of it the Taunusturm, the Eurotower (former seat of the EZB), the Gallileo-High Rise, the Silver Tower and finally the NM-1 High Rise standing at the shore. It is the banking district which earned Frankfurt its nickname Mainhattan.\nFurther along the Main river we see the buildings along the Mainkai, which is the complete old town of Frankfurt. However, heavy war destructions led to a relatively homogenous river front of after war buildings – still some historic buildings are catching the eye. From left to right we can see (following the skyscrapers) the St. Leonhard Church, the towers of the new town hall, the Paulskirche (Church), then the buildings around the central Römerberg Square at the big building crane with the historical museum of Frankfurt occupying the historic Saalhof Buildings in the foreground. Further right we see the round tower of the Schirn Kunsthalle (Art Museum) and finally the monumental Frankfurt Cathedral (the Kaiserdom St. Bartholomäus).\nThis cityscape panorama of Frankfurt on the Main was presented in week 28 of our 101 weeks 101 cities of europe project (along with more Frankfurt previews)."

Currently run by Bernard and Olivier Coste. Based in the Languedoc region of Southern France. The Domaine Montrose coat of arms of three lizards has become the logo used on all of their wines. The name Montrose refers to its geographic location on a volcano (Mont) and to the pink (Rose) flowers from the almond trees surrounding the vineyard. The vineyard is located around the domaine on the “Côtes de Thôngue” terroir in the Mediterranean southern France. They encourage sustainable farming of their 85 hectares in the belief that it protects the environment but also better expresses the local terroir in the wines. There are 3 types of soil volcanic, chalky clay and siliceious-clay gravel. They are able to cultivate local and foreign grape varieties from Rolle to Cabernet Sauvignon, vinify them and then produce beautifully married blends. Fully thermo-controlled steel tanks are used for fermenting and ageing all of the cepages. Wines produced include Chardonnay, Viognier, Rose, Merlot Syrah, Cabernet Syrah. They produce a blended range of red, white and rose wines called La Balade and their prestige wine is called Salamandre. Its 2012 Rose won a silver award at the Decanter World Wine Awards in 2013.\nAlmost akin to a white, the wines in this category feature the Gamay grape from Beaujolais. Tend to be pale red in colour with refreshing redcurrant and red berry fruit flavours. Great at lunchtime or served slightly chilled in the summer. Will go down well with non-red wine drinkers."

This pairs security capabilities built into Intel silicon with advanced defences against firmware threats.\nIntel Security Essentials provide a built-in foundation for improved security features and are available across Intel processor lines. The Eclypsium Platform, now generally available, builds upon Intel’s foundation by analyzing the system configuration and ensuring the latest firmware is deployed. With Eclypsium, the end user can see the status of their firmware patch levels, gain visibility into firmware misconfigurations, and validate the integrity of Intel systems as part of the supply chain, even through the cloud.\nThis can also help protect against 'Evil Maid' attacks against devices such as laptops or phones that are left unattended, for example in a hotel room or at an airport. This uses a USB-stick to compromise the firmware with a fake password prompt identical to the original. Once the password is input, the compromised firmware sends the password to the attacker and removes itself after a reboot. However, this nodes need the hacker to return to the device a second time to steal the now-accessible data.\n“Security sensitive organizations need to be able to inspect these low-level technologies to look for signs of malicious activity,” said Window Snyder, Chief Software Security Officer and General Manager, Platform Security Division at Intel.\nFirmware Visibility and Patch Management - Visibility of firmware versions across hardware components and centralised patch updates.\nProtection From Supply Chain Attacks – Find firmware that has been compromised in the hardware supply chain even before deployment.\nProtecting Cloud Infrastructure – Help protect cloud and bare-metal infrastructure from implants at the firmware level or software-level attacks that can spread to the firmware.\nVerifying Device Integrity After Infection - Bring firmware security into the workflow to help ensure devices are clean at the firmware level before re-imaging.\nThis combines Murata’s communications modules and sensor technologies with the eSoftLink IoT platform (which leverages AI to provide end users with predictive consumption information), providing a seamless private and secure IoT package.

The integration provided by the OSD32MP1 SiP makes the solution suitable for any application needing a versatile applications processor in a small package.\nThe SIP integration allows users to take advantage of a full microprocessor without the increase in complexity that typically comes from routing DDR and complex power management. The ability to reuse firmware and the elimination of complexity makes the OSD32MP1 the easiest path for designers to move from a microcontroller to Linux.\n\"The continued push of IoT and the demand for more data has required many applications to migrate from an existing microcontroller design to one based on a microprocessor running Linux. There are usually two major hurdles that prevent this from being an easy transition; porting their application, and complicated hardware designs,\" said Greg Sheridan, Marketing Manager at Octavo Systems. \"Integrating the new STM32MP1 into the OSD32MP1 removes these roadblocks, greatly reducing the effort required to migrate from a microcontroller to a microprocessor running Linux.\"\nBeyond simplifying the design process, the OSD32MP1 reduces the cost of PCBs by needing less pace and less complicated manufacturing processes, like Laser Vias or Via-in-Pad. The OSD32MP1 also simplifies the task of sourcing components by integrating over 100 devices from multiple vendors into a single component.\n\"Having ST ask us to be one of their partners at launch really validates our vision for the future of electronics design. Designers will demand more integrated solutions to start to develop their unique applications faster rather than spend time on tedious tasks that don't differentiate their product,\" adds Gene Frantz, CTO Octavo Systems. \"System-in-Package is the solution to provide this tremendous level of integration.\"\nDesign resources for the OSD32MP1 are available today on the Octavo Systems website. Samples will be available in Q3 with full production scheduled for Q4. \"Pricing is still being finalized and will be in-line with the cost of an equivalent system designed with discrete components,\" said Greg.\nSTMicroelectronics has launched a multicore processor with ARM Cortex-A and -M cores and Linux support for Industrial, Consumer, Smart Home, Health and Wellness applications.\nThe STM32MP1 series supports OpenSTLinux as a mainlined, open-source Linux distribution to extend the STM32 family. With this combination of MPU and software, ST has assembled all the pieces to match the product supply requirements of many industrial and professional applications and the STM32MP1 is included in ST’s rolling 10-years longevity commitment.\nThe Cortex-A cores running Linux allows standard high level software such as graphics for user interfaces to be used, while the -M cores provide real time control and low power operation.\nFor example, by stopping Cortex-A7 execution and running only from the more efficient Cortex-M4, power can typically be reduced to 25%. From this mode, going to Standby further cuts power by 2.5k times – while still supporting the resumption of Linux execution in 1 to 3 seconds, depending on the application.\nThe STM32MP1 embeds a 3D Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) to support Human Machine Interface (HMI) displays. It also supports a wide range of external DDR SDRAM and Flash Memories. Moreover, the STM32MP1 embeds a large set of peripherals that can be seamlessly allocated either to Cortex-A / Linux or Cortex-M / Real-time activities. The STM32MP1 series are available in a range of BGA packages to support the lowest PCB cost structure and use the smallest board space.\nThe STM32MP1 series comprise dual Arm Cortex-A7 application processor cores running at 650MHz and a high-performance Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller core running at 209MHz. The STM32MP1 supports cost-efficient and DDR SDRAMs, including DDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR2, LPDDR3 32/16-bit at 533MHz, which prevents performance bottlenecks and bandwidth issues on MPU systems. On top of this, the STM32MP1 supports a wide range of Flash products: eMMC, SD card, SLC NAND, SPI NAND and Quad-SPI NOR Flashes.\nThe 3D Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) provides for advanced HMI development, based on OpenGL® ES 2.0 interface and native support for Linux and various application frameworks, including Android Qt. The STM32MP1 supports 24-bit parallel RGB displays up to WXGA at 60fps and MIPI® DSI with 2 data lanes running at 1Gbps.\nThis 3D graphics processor will enable equipment such as industrial control panels to enhance user experiences. Brian Edmond, President of Crank Software, which produces the Storyboard™ user-interface tool suite, commented, “The STM32MP1 platform strengthens ST’s solution and aligns with Storyboard’s industry-leading scalability. The powerful 3D GPU from Vivante® lets Storyboard users create the rich graphical experiences needed in today's embedded markets.\"\nIn order to assure Customer code is fully trusted, the STM32MP1 Series embeds hardware security features that include TrustZone, cryptography, hash, Secure Boot, anti-tamper pins, and a real-time clock.\nThe STM32MP1 also leverages advanced IPs from STM32 MCUs. STM32MP1 has 37x communication interfaces, such as 3x USB2.0 including 2x High-Speed, 1x Gigabit Ethernet GMAC, 2x CAN FD and standard I²C, UARTs and SPIs. It also comes with a range of analog peripherals including 2x 16b ADCs, 2x 12b DACs and On-chip LDOs. The STM32MP1 supports 29x timers and 3x watchdogs. Depending on packages, it can also support up to 176 GPIOs.\nST completes the chipset with the STPMIC1, a dedicated Power-Management IC (PMIC) that integrates four DC/DC buck converters, six LDOs, a DC/DC boost converter, and USB VBUS and general-purpose power switches, creating a space and BOM savings to supply all required power rails for the STM32MP1 and for other components on the board. Using power-consumption optimization, the STPMIC1 is an ideal companion chip for the STM32MP1 Series in battery-powered applications.\nTo accelerate development, ST is demonstrating its commitment to software development with the release of OpenSTLinux Distribution as a mainlined open-source Linux distribution. OpenSTLinux has already been reviewed and accepted by the Linux community: Linux Foundation, Yocto project and Linaro. The distribution contains all the essential building blocks for running software on the application-processor cores.\nThe OpenSTLinux Distribution supports development on the STM32MP1’s Cortex-A7 cores and contains important elements that include Linux BSP, kernel, drivers, boot chain, and secure OS (OP-TEE: Trusted Execution Environment).\nEnhanced STM32Cube tools, specially upgraded from the STM32Cube package for Cortex-M microcontrollers, features all necessary characteristics – and more -- to accelerate microprocessor development using Arm Cortex-A-core MPUs. ST’s solution simplifies setting up MPU projects and configuring the on-chip resources.\nFPGA designer Achronix has launched a partner programme for EDA tools, software, and IP vendors with solutions and services for its Speedster FPGAs, Speedchip chiplet technology, and Speedcore eFPGA custom IP-block technology.\nThe programme connects Achronix’s partners with the company’s customers to provide better access to developers who are creating designs based on Achronix’s technologies, or considering the use of Achronix’s programmable silicon and IP technologies.\nPartners have the ability to promote their company and proven solutions on their own, individual partner pages located on the Achronix.com website.\nAchronix’s ecosystem partners augment Achronix’s own ACE design tools and IP products with expert design support for Achronix-specific, FPGA-based development to shorten design cycles for complex electronic systems and accelerate time to market. Achronix offerings include programmable FPGA fabrics, discrete high-performance and high-density FPGAs with hardwired system-level blocks, datacentre and HPC hardware accelerator boards, and best-in-class EDA software supporting all Achronix products.\nInnophase has launched a single chip multiprotocol transceiver for the Internet of Things (IoT) with what the company claims is the industry's lowest power consumption.\nThe Talaria TWO platform combines the transceiver, MAC/PHY, digital power amplifier and an embedded ARM processor for battery-based IoT applications. Operating with a Delivery Traffic Indication Map (DTIM) every third frame (DTIM3), the chip uses half the power of the leading low power Wi-Fi chips, says the company.\nThe chip actively manages multiprotocol coexistence for 802.11b/g/n WiFi and BLE 5.0 for demanding edge-of-network applications. Initial customer products developed using the Talaria TWO wireless platform have shown battery life improvements of more than 50% versus competitive solutions.\nThe Talaria TWO platform uses InnoPhase’s PolaRFusion radio architecture, which processes radio signals using polar coordinates rather than traditional IQ coordinates. This digitally-intensive radio solution dramatically reduces the amount of power required to transmit, process, and receive wireless information using industry standard wireless protocols. It achieves this by moving most of the radio signal processing from power-hungry analogue circuits, found in today’s IQ-architecture wireless solutions, into power and size efficient digital logic.\nCustomers are now sampling the extreme low power Talaria TWO wireless platform with full commercial availability and certification slated for mid-2019.\nOpen source specialist Arduino has launched an IoT Cloud as part of its professional IoT strategy.\nThe cloud capability is aimed at embedded developers and system integrators as well as Arduio's more traditional maker hobbyists as an easy-to-use Internet of Things application platform.\nThe IoT Cloud includes secure provision, connection and authentication of devices in the field and ensures all data transmitted between the device and Arduino’s cloud is confidential and tamper-proof. Client authentication (X.509 certificates) is adopted for asymmetric-key based authentication, while Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used for securing all traffic to and from IoT Cloud.\nwww.arduino.cc/en/IoT/HomePage or create.arduino.cc/iot to download."

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic lawmakers must soon decide whether President Barack Obama is leading them toward statesmanlike courage or political folly.\nObama used his first State of the Union speech Wednesday to push nervous Democrats to forge ahead on health care, despite voters' worries and opposition from newly strengthened Republicans. Sharpening his focus on the economy, he offered a hodgepodge of tax breaks and other incentives to create new jobs.\nFor Republicans, Obama blended a mix of overtures and digs. But he mainly addressed fellow Democrats, who still can enact his agenda if they overcome fears fueled by events such as last week's stunning GOP victory in the Massachusetts Senate race.\nThat setback may have cost Democrats their filibuster-proof Senate majority, Obama said, but \"we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills.\"\nHe accepted partial blame for the deep troubles facing his health care push, but he implored lawmakers to finish the task rather than yield to public opposition.\n\"The longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became,\" Obama told the joint session of Congress and a nationwide TV audience. But health care problems will continue for millions, he said, and \"I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.\"\nHouse and Senate Democratic leaders are scrambling to see if they can salvage the ambitious health care package, which Republicans almost universally oppose. Obama's pep talk was a call to arms, but he offered no new strategies for overcoming the steep parliamentary and political hurdles they face.\nThe president devoted most of his 65-minute speech to job-creation proposals, such as eliminating capital gains taxes on small business investment and extending tax breaks for businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. But those proposals also face uncertainty in Congress, where Senate Democrats say they may need a selective, piecemeal approach to win enough votes.\nObama said Republicans share a responsibility for governing, and he proposed meeting with their House and Senate leaders monthly. But his olive branch seemed brittle at times.\nWithout naming George W. Bush, he pointedly noted that the previous administration left him a big deficit and a deeply troubled economy. For good measure, Obama said the United States killed more al-Qaida terrorists in 2009 than in 2008.\nObama rebuked the Supreme Court for a recent decision that \"reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests\" and foreign corporations to make unlimited campaign contributions. At that, conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito made a dismissive face, shook his head in disagreement and seemed to mouth the words \"not true\" as the president spoke.\nRepublicans in the House chamber generally greeted such remarks with stony gazes and smirks. The statements they issued as soon as Obama finished — or even before he finished, in some cases — were equally icy.\n\"We had hoped to hear a new commitment to keep his promises to govern from the center, change the tone in Washington, and work with both parties in a bipartisan way to help small businesses create jobs and get our economy moving again,\" said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio. \"Unfortunately, the president and the Democrats in charge of Congress still aren't listening to the American people.\"\nVice President Joe Biden, appearing in an interview Thursday morning on NBC's \"Today\" show, described Obama as upset with the way his program has been handled in Congress.\n\"One of the things that's most frustrating to him,\" Biden said, \"is the obstructionist ways of the United States Senate, on the part of the Republicans, requiring 60 votes, a supermajority, for virtually every single, solitary initiative we've had. Now that we have 59 votes, it's time for everybody to start taking responsibility.\"\nObama has the luxury of waiting until 2012 to seek re-election, while all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate seats are up for grabs this November. Some Democrats most nervous about the election are urging the administration to slow down, especially on the health care issue that has dominated Congress's attention for months.\nObama gave them no comfort. \"Change has not come fast enough\" for millions of Americans, he said. \"We must answer history's call.\"\nAt the same time, however, the president tried to give Democrats some political cover on other sensitive issues, such as the bank bailouts that angered many voters.\n\"We all hated the bank bailout,\" he said. \"I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\"\nThe president also tried to chip away at GOP talking points.\n\"Let me repeat, we cut taxes,\" he said, citing his administration's tax cuts \"for 95 percent of working families.\"\nRepublicans are quick to note that the deficit has soared during Obama's year in office, and proposals such as the health care overhaul would impose new taxes on high-end medical insurance policies, among other things.\nIn their post-speech commentaries, several Democrats ignored nearly all of Obama's remarks except those aimed at creating jobs, the biggest issue on voters' minds.\n\"His focus was right where it belongs: on jobs and the economy, and on reforming the financial sector,\" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. \"He acknowledged his own mistakes, and he avoided pointing partisan fingers.\"\nMichael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was less charitable.\nIf Obama is serious about improving the economy, Steele said, \"he will give Republicans a seat at the table. If not, then we know that this is just more spin, arrogance and a refusal to listen to the American people.\""

The AKC registry accepted the breed in 1998.\nThey were resident in a harsh environment, withstanding temperature extremes to carry out flock protection against large predators. This led to a hardy, large working dog that could endure long days of work.\nHeight at Withers: female 27\" (68.5 cm), male 29\" (73.5 cm) minimum.\nWeight: females 80-120 lb (36.5-54.6 kg), males 110-150 lb (50-68 kg).\nCoat: Two coat variants exist; the Short and the Rough. Rough is about 4\" (10) cm in length, while Short is 1\" (2.54 cm). The undercoat is dense. Some feathering may be present. Color or markings are not limited in this breed, but fawn with a dark mask is common.\nPoints of Conformation: They possess a rugged build, large body frame with heavy muscling and bone, the head is large and the skull has small furrow in the midline. The flews are dry. Eyes are dark brown to amber and almond in shape, palpebral margins dark. Blue or odd irises are not allowed. The ears are triangular, the apex is rounded, and they are folded along the head. The muzzle is square, the nose is dark (brown or black), the neck is moderate in length and musculature, and with a ruff of skin and fur. The topline slopes down towards the croup, Thorax is deep and the ribs are well sprung, and an abdominal tuck up is present. The tail reaches the tarsi, and is high set. At rest, the tail is curved along the back of the legs, and when active it is up high and moves to do a \"wheel\" movement. Limbs are straight, metacarpals heavy, oval feet have thick pads, and are compact. Some specimens have double dewclaws in back. Dewclaws front and back may be removed. Gait is smooth and long in stride, ground-covering with significant agility."

The inspiring group also dismantled and removed a 20′ table and assembled 8 new classroom tables for our Vocational Training Program at Duvall Homes’ Opportunities Enrichment Center.\nWe are most grateful for their hard work, and were impressed with the speed and commitment in which it was completed.\nA special thank you to Commander M. Juanique Wallace of Navy Recruiting District Jacksonville; and to Chief Jericus Lewis, NCI Jason Stoudt, HM2 Jennifer Denis, QM1 Abbe Beaston and AWF2 Kenneth Connelly from DeLand’s Navy Recruiting Station.\nMarch 21, 2019 – Direct Support Professional, Jessica, personalized a blanket for a long-time resident of Duvall, Snookie.\n“It is so beautiful and kind of Jessica to do this for my Snookie,” said Tess, who visits her daughter every week during Adult Day Training on our beautiful Glenwood campus.\nTess champions all Duvall staff, praising their efforts and dedication to caring for those we serve.\nFebruary 7, 2019 – When it comes to building a new group home for individuals with special needs, there is a great deal more to consider than there is for your average home. And such a project demands a special builder — one with years of construction experience, insight and patience. After a monthslong search, Marsha Shankleton, Duvall Homes’ Chief Operating Officer, found the perfect builder.\nFunded in part by a grant from the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, last spring Duvall began the long process of searching for a parcel of land in West Volusia, proximal to public transportation and large enough to build a 3300 SqFt. home for six residents with Down syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities who are cared for 24-7 by trained and certified Direct Support Professionals. The home would need both living and office space, a spacious porch and grounds for enjoying the outdoors, and sufficient parking for special needs vehicles. A 2.5-acre plot was obtained in North DeLand.\nSo who is the builder? “We needed someone who knew how to marry the commercial safety of a sprinkler system, fire and carbon monoxide alarms and adequate parking, with the comfort and privacy of group home living,” said Shankelton.\nView additional images from the build of Duvall Homes’ new Group Home on our Facebook Page here.\nFebruary 5, 2019 – In Duvall Homes’ Adult Day Training Program, at our Opportunities Enrichment Center, participants develop skills to help them achieve the highest level of independence possible. Great volunteer experiences result from this training, like bagging at our local Publix.\nLearn more about Duvall’s Day Training Program.\nJanuary 30, 2019 – Duvall staff and residents cherish our community of volunteers! Thank you to the student volunteers of Father Lopez Catholic High School who recently sanded, cleaned, primed and painted 4 large picnic tables on the grounds of Duvall’s Glenwood campus in DeLand.\nOnce the weather warmed, the tables were enjoyed by participants in Duvall’s Adult Day Training Program following an outdoor stroll. There are also some fun “artistic” plans for these beautiful, now like-new, picnic tables, which will incorporate Duvall’s Art For Everyone Program.\nIf you know of a group of students, or employees, interested in providing service for Duvall Homes, please contact lhabermehl@duvallhomes.org. Come be a part of #TheDuvallDifference!\nJanuary 11, 2019 – Duvall Homes celebrates the new year by sharing a sneak peek at the home site of our new group home going up in DeLand!

Duvall Homes is grateful for the generosity shown by the Lions Club.\nOnly a few images were captured as we are in the middle of securing new photo releases for the protection of our residents. Thank you for your understanding. Just note, the residents had a fantastic experience.\nBe sure to follow Duvall news and social media posts (bottom of page) for inspiring news and events, and for additional images as releases are received.\nDecember 18, 2018 – A few weeks ago, Duvall’s Day Training Program began the process to adopt a US Military Soldier through AdoptaUSSoldier.org. We want our service members to know we are thinking of them and want to thank them for their service.\nA deployed unit has now been matched with Duvall Homes and the collection of requested items has begun.\nIn a short time, approximately 70 items were collected; however, more is needed. The plan is to correspond with Adopt A US Soldier – Official and support our assigned unit, not just for the holidays, but through 2019.

Their sensory platform, operated by caregivers, helps engage special populations. Watch their video on CBS. So, how does Duvall fit in? Because possible benefits for people with developmental disabilities were recognized, we reached out to the Rendever team. As a result, a plan was set in motion for Duvall to test their virtual reality 360° equipment. And empowerment through VR emerged.\nRand’s background is in Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering. Rendever’s CTO, Tom Neumann’s, is a successful developer of VR applications. Since cofounding Rendever in 2016, Rand and Neumann have embarked on a journey to share their unique platform all over the world.\nADT Support Specialist, Cindy Jakobowski, experiences life on a farm in VR – one of numerous 360 Rendever videos engaged by residents.\nRendever continues to expand its reach. Their software is not just in retirement communities and long-term care facilities; they’re in single family homes and even cancer treatment centers. Among other things, Rendever’s platform provides a diversion for pain and anxiety.\nDuvall Homes is fortunate to be given the opportunity to sample this innovative VR program, and are grateful to Rand and the Rendever team. While additional time is needed to determine the full benefits for clients of Duvall Homes, one thing is certain. Duvall’s team of Direct Support Professionals, Specialists and clients were able to explore a whole new universe. And, for a time, were taken to parts of the world they would otherwise not have gone.\nWatch Steven (top image) pilot a single engine prop plane with Wings of Storm, a Croatian Air Force Aerobatic Team.\nRead Expanding Worlds with additional VR photos in Duvall’s 2018 Fall Newsletter.\nDecember 11, 2018 – Duvall is in Daytona’s MY COAST.

Matt, a relatively new Support Specialist, guessed the closest number of candies inside the Tower of Candy without going over. The seven stacked containers had 547 pieces of candy. Lotto tickets, tea towels and money were inside the 17-inch tall tower. In total, Matt won a prize valued at more than $100, which was part of some employee appreciation holiday fun.\nAccounts Receivable Specialist, Bobbie Daley, won a surprise 2nd Place gift because she guessed the next closest amount without going over. Bobbie celebrated 10 years at Duvall this past June!\nDuvall’s Chief Operating Officer, Marsha Shankleton, presented the prizes.

Flip through this month’s issue of Evolve, the business publication of the Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce to learn more. Duvall Homes is a Daytona Chamber member, and recognizes that what attracts families and guardians to Duvall is not just our residential supportive services and programs, but also the national appeal of the County of Volusia.\nOceanfront beaches, great eateries and ecotourism – from the east side of the county to the west – are just a few options to fill calendars of visiting families and friends all year round. Visit our great beaches; tour various springs and waterways; bike, jog or walk miles of natural and paved trails; select from any type of cuisine you can think of; visit historical landmarks, museums and more.\nThe best thing of all is that residents of Duvall Homes are fortunate to be able to visit the same attractions that 10 million people come to visit each and every year.

They chose us as their selected nonprofit to volunteer their outreach services.\nEarlier this month, on Saturday, November 10, more than 30 students and leaders travelled from St. Pete’s Beach, Florida, to DeLand as part of their Mystery Service weekend. They did not know where they were traveling or for who they were volunteering – a rather fun way to engage youth in leadership service rolls.\nAfter arriving and learning a brief history of the Duvall mission, the students went to work painting fences and parking poles, collecting landscape debris and organizing McGaffin Hall at our Glenwood Campus.\nThese inspiring youth are committed to improving the lives of others. They use their hands and hearts to help nonprofit organizations not just in Florida, but across the US and world! We wish them great blessings as they head to Puerto Rico this coming spring!\nThank you to Jeanne Haemmelmann, Associate Minister for Youth & Young Adults of Pass-A-Grille Church for organizing their morning of service.

If you want tips on finding the best prices, check out our post How to Buy the Clothes You Want at Clearance Prices. It just makes good financial sense to make your clothing last as long as possible.\nGet the most life from your wardrobe with the following regimen.\nUse good hangers. Solid wood hangers help keep the shoulders in your jackets or sweaters intact. In contrast, wire or thin plastic hangers cause those annoying and unsightly bumps in the shoulders, stretching and warping.\nDo your laundry inside out. Color loss occurs in clothing not just from washing. However, from the clothes rubbing against each other. Therefore, to prevent jeans, pants, or any other items from fading as quickly, turn them inside out before washing.\nStuff your shoes. Wad up a newspaper or packing paper and stuff them into your shoes and boots to help them keep their shape longer.\nWatch the fabric softener. Do not use fabric softener when washing workout or outdoor clothing designed to wick moisture. The fabric softener clogs the micropores in the clothing preventing them from wicking away sweat and moisture.\nHang an indoor clothesline. Even if the sun is not out, or you live in an apartment, you can still hang a short indoor clothesline to dry socks, t-shirts, bras, underwear, and other items. This prevents damage and fading done to gentler materials in the dryer. It also prevents your clothing from breaking down in the dryer. A clothesline also has the bonus of saving you some money on electricity.\nWash in cold water. To prevent the colors from fading from your favorite outfits, wash them in cold water and they will remain brighter much longer. Your clothes will get just as clean in cold water as in warm or hot water because it is the agitation of the washer, not the temperature of the water, which does the cleaning. It will also save you money on your energy bill because you will not have to run the water heater as much.\nBefore you leave, save money on laundry detergent and other household products, print or load coupons to a store loyalty program below."

Apparently, this is their most innovative release in years so we'll probably have all 24, thanks.\nThis is likely to be you on 29th September, because that's the date they're due to be landing in the UK for £17.50 each.\nWhich shade is your fave?

But its hard to explain why, and it might not be even Windows 10’s fault.\nOn-screen keyboard doesn’t pop up automatically for Firefox, but does for Edge (Surface Pro 3 in tablet mode). One assumes because Edge is an Universal App?\nTraditional Chinese keyboard doesn’t display candidate list automatically; you have to press down-arrow every time to see the complete list. That is 1/4 to 1/3 more keystrokes per Chinese character!\nPressing the touchscreen for any action (e.g. close windows, ‘Ok’ button etc) has a minute but discernible lag, especially if you are used to an iPad. Two finger touchscreen scrolling is great though. Does this lie with Win10 or Surface Pro 3?\nOr maybe I’m just a grumpy old man set in my ways. I will seriously mourn the day Microsoft stops supporting Windows 7.\nIts finally finished. Windows Update has been calculating which updates to apply since 9am. So that’s more than 6 hours to calculate – now comes the actual update part.\nFair enough, this is a fresh reinstall of Windows 7 on a relic of a CPU: AMD Athlon x2. But its desktop class and not RAM constrained.\nI reckon Windows Update should be the real-world metric to assess how fast a system is. Sure, this way of measuring has a big flaw, since new updates are constantly available so updating at different times will produce different results. Regardless, it’ll still be a good-enough rough measure of how a system would perform for the average person using the PC in real life."

        "text": "Addicted and concerned or curious to try but scared? Read this.\nThis story first ran in April 2016, but eyelash extensions are more popular than ever. If you’ve been considering taking the leap, or already have weekend plans to do so, take a stroll down memory lane to learn the dos and don’ts and be fully prepared for weekend eye-batting.\nThe title says it all: I was addicted to eyelash extensions and was pretty sure they were making my lids bald.\nI bought a package in the beginning of January for the sake of jumpstarting my winter beauty routine. Friends who peer pressured me into re-joining the sisterhood after a brief dalliance with eye fur helped rationalize the spending (“You don’t have kids!” was a fun and logical one), and after a single session I was back at it like Ja Rule during his 2014 return tour.\nImagine waking up and looking like Zayn Mailk every day.\nIt was like that. And because it was like that, I knew the devil had to be nearby. Anything this beautiful is too good to be true.\nSo I started asking friends in The Cult questions like: What happens now — do we do this forever? Are our eyelashes falling out? Are our eyelids going to be permanently bald if we stop?\nThe answer to all three questions, from nearly everyone I surveyed, was yes. Full of denial, I took my queries to the Internet.\nI spiraled into a deep, dark underbelly of forums until I realized that what I should be doing was talking to actual, reputable experts. That’s where Dr. Leslie Gerstman, an aesthetic physician, Karolina Osiecka-Bula, the esthetician who applies the eyelash extensions at Dr. Gerstman’s office, and Courtney Akai, the founder of Courtney Akai Lash Boutique (who has been doing lashes for 10 years!), came to my rescue. I asked them every neurotic question one could possible have; they answered.\nFor anyone intrigued, curious or terrified, there’s good news in the FAQs below.\nThe first thing that all three experts assured me was that, yes, lash extensions are perfectly safe when applied properly. Note that qualifier: “When applied properly” is key.\n1) The weight and length should be customized to the individual. Not everyone’s natural lashes can hold the thick drama of a Kardashian-esque fur fan. Extensions that are too heavy can lead to breakage or premature lash loss.\n2) Lashes should only be applied to one natural lash at a time. Your real lashes should never be glued together in order to support the extensions. “If you can’t comb through them, something’s wrong,” Osiecka told me. Natural lashes that are clumped together have a higher chances of being ripped out from the root, which can lead to permanent damage to the hair follicle.\nHow do I know if this is a “good” place or not?\nYour esthetician should conduct a consultation with you to determine length and weight.\nYou should also feel comfortable asking your esthetician how long she’s been doing extensions. Akai, Dr. Gerstman and Osiecka-Bula all told me that perfecting the art of lash application takes years. This is not the same thing as getting your nails done; this involves your eyes. Go with someone who has at least two years of experience and if you can find them — positive reviews online.\nI’m never supposed to get these wet, right?\nYou should avoid getting them wet within the first 24-48 hours of application. After that, you should absolutely wash them. If you don’t, you become prone to ingrown lashes, lash mites (I KNOW!?!!?!?) or infection.\nYour esthetician should recommend one as well.\nShould I be able to feel them?\nNo. If your skin itches or feels like it’s being pinched, Dr. Gerstman says this is likely due to poor glue application and stresses that eyelashes extensions should feel as though you were were wearing nothing at all. There should be no glue on your skin; there should be no extension attached to your skin — just extension attached to natural lash. If you feel like something’s wrong, go back to your esthetician immediately.\nHow often should I be getting them reapplied?\nEvery 3 to 4 weeks depending on your preference for fullness. Estheticians may tailor this to the individual.\nI want to take a break and I want them off now. Can I remove them myself?\nNo. Pulling eyelash extensions out yourself can damage your natural lashes. Book an appointment and have a professional remove them for you. Yes, this is annoying (and can cost $45-50), but so are bald eyelids.\nWhat’s the deal with growth serums?\nDr. Gerstman recommends the FDA-approved eyelash growth serum, Latisse. In fact, when customers come in with damaged lashes, she or Osiecka-Bula will send them home with Latisse to use for a month before applying extensions. “I don’t want to stress out your natural lashes if they’re not in good condition,” Osiecka-Bula told me.\nI had heard Latisse can cause brown spots in your irises. Though Dr. Gerstman confirms that brown spots are listed as a potential side effect, she has never had this happen to a client. The other possibility is darkening of the skin above the eyelash line, although the one time Dr. Gerstman saw this, it went away after her client stopped using Latisse.\nMeanwhile, Courtney Akai swears by Revitalash Advanced and says that it can begin to work in as little as three weeks.\nAnother option the experts recommend: an over the counter, vitamin-packed supplement called Biotin (a water-soluble B vitamin that promotes hair, skin and nail health). Consult your doctor before use.\nALL I CARE ABOUT IS WHETHER OR NOT EXTENSIONS WILL MAKE MY LASHES FALL OUT!!!!!!!!\nAgain, if applied properly, eyelash extensions will not make your real lashes fall out prematurely.\nYour real eyelashes shed on a 30-day cycle, so your lashes will fall out naturally. Losing 3 to 5 lashes a day is normal. Having a long, thick extension attached to your regular lash just calls more attention to the normal loss.\nThis is one of the worst parts about eyelash extensions: the eyelash dysmorphia. It’s very easy to forget what your real lashes look like, and seeing them can be shocking even when nothing’s wrong.\nIs there any possibility that, wallet aside, eyelash extensions are good for me?\nYes. Akai, Dr. Gerstman and Osieck-Bula all told me that they have seen many of their clients’ natural lashes improve with extension use. Think about it: you’re not applying and taking off mascara, you’re not sleeping in mascara, and you’re generally more careful and gentle with the area once you have extensions.\nThey’re like hairy little babies or Zayn Malik; you can’t help but be kind to them.\nCheck out Dr. Leslie Gerstman’s website and follow her practice on Instagram @drgerstmannyc and Facebook; Follow Karolina Osiecka-Bula on Instagram @prettyfunoska — lots of lash pics.

They sacrifice a loving relationship with Jehovah for material things which are dead and cannot love them back.\nPerhaps that is why depression is a pandemic today.\nThere is an old saying that says that when the times are good the churches are empty, when they times are bad the churches are full.

Agile is efficient when the cost of making a change is lower than the cost of an iteration. In other words, your iterations have to be profitable (at least in aggregate.).\nDeploying software to a server costs almost nothing, so you can iterate every five minutes and make money. Except when you make a mistake and deploy something broken, which can cost you in damaged customer reputation. In many cases these are costs that can be absorbed, but fail too often and the product is doomed.\nAgile works by holding time and effort constant, but letting scope vary. That means using agile techniques to handle hardware projects where scope can't vary (like deploying routers to remote sites) can fail much more easily. If any component is delayed, the whole product is delayed, and other expenses rise: rescheduling installers often has a cascading effect on the rest of the project."

        "text": "Never assume that a firearm is unloaded. The only certain way to ensure that a firearm has the chamber(s) empty is to open the chamber and visually and physically examine the inside to see if a round is present. Removing or unloading the magazine will not guarantee that a firearm is unloaded or cannot fire. Shotguns and rifles can be checked by cycling or removing all rounds and by then opening and inspecting the chamber so that a visual inspection of the chamber for any remaining rounds can be made.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that children under the age of 18 or other unauthorized persons do not gain access to your firearm. To reduce the risk of accidents involving children, unload your firearm, lock it and store the ammunition in a separate locked location. Please note that devices intended to prevent accidents – for example, cable locks, chamber plugs, etc, – may not prevent to use or misuse of your firearm by a determined person. Firearm storage in a steel gun safe may be more appropriate to reduce the likelihood of intentional misuse of a firearm by an unauthorized child or person.\nShooting at the surface of water or at a rock or other hard surface increases the chance of ricochets or fragmentation of the bullet or shot, which can result in the projectile striking an unintended or peripheral target.\n5) Know the safety features of the firearm you are using, but remember: safety devices are not a substitute for safe handling procedures.\nNever rely solely on a safety device to prevent an accident. It is imperative that you know and use the safety features of the particular firearm you are handling, but accidents can best be prevented by following the safe handling procedures described in these safety rules and elsewhere in the product manual. To further familiarize yourself with the proper use of this or other firearms, take a Firearms Safety Course taught by an expert in firearms use and safety procedures.\nStore and carry your firearm so that dirt or lint does not accumulate in the working parts. Clean and oil your firearm, following the instructions provided in this manual, after each use to prevent corrosion, damage to the barrel or accumulation of impurities which can prevent use of the gun in an emergency. Always check the bore and chamber(s) prior to loading to ensure that they are clean and free from obstructions. Firing with an obstruction in the barrel or chamber can rupture the barrel and injure you or others nearby. In the event you hear an unusual noise when shooting, stop firing immediately, engage the manual safety and unload the firearm. Make sure the chamber and barrel are free from any obstruction, like a bullet blocked inside the barrel due to defective or improper ammunition.\nOnly use factory-loaded, new ammunition manufactured to industry specifications: CIP ( Europe and elsewhere), SAAMI (U.S.A.). Be certain that each round you use is in the proper caliber or gauge and type for the particular firearm. The caliber or gauge of the firearm is clearly marked on the barrels of shotguns and on the slide or barrel of pistols. The use of reloaded or remanufactured ammunition can increase the likelihood of excessive cartridge pressures, case-head ruptures or other defects in theammunition that can cause damage to your firearm and injury to yourself or others nearby.\nThe chance that gas, gunpowder or metal fragments will blow back and injure a shooter who is firing a gun is rare, but the injury that can be sustained in such circumstances can be severe, including the possible loss of eyesight. A shooter must always wear impact resistant shooting glasses when firing any firearm. Earplugs or other high-quality hearing protectors help reduce the chance of hearing damage from shooting.\nOpen and empty the chamber(s) of your firearm and engage the manual safety before climbing or descending a tree or before climbing a fence or jumping over a ditch or other obstruction. Never pull or push a loaded firearm toward yourself or another person. Always unload a firearm, visually and physically check to see that the magazine, loading mechanism and chamber are unloaded, and action is open before handing it to another person. Never take a firearm from another person unless it is unloaded, visually and physically checked to confirm it is unloaded, and the action is open.\nDo not drink and shoot. If you take medication that can impair motor reactions or judgment, do not handle a firearm while you are under the influence of the medication.\nUnload a firearm before putting it in a vehicle (chamber empty, magazine empty). Hunters and target shooters should load their firearm only at their destination, and only when they are ready to shoot. If you carry a firearm for self protection, leaving the chamber unloaded can reduce the chance of an unintentional discharge.\nDischarging firearms in poorly ventilated areas, cleaning firearms, or handling ammunition may result in exposure to lead and other substances known to cause birth defects, reproductive harm, and other serious physical injury. Have adequate ventilation at all times. Wash hands thoroughly after exposure."

        "text": "A look at what goes on behind the scenes of your favorite food Instagram.\nAs the proud co-owner of the Instagram handle @meatballsandmojitos, I understand the struggles of an Instagram foodie on a personal level. It changes both your personal eating habits and your social eating experiences for the better (and worse). This brings me to the five struggles that only my fellow Insta-foodies would understand.\nYou hear about a delicious new food spot; you gather your friends and make the trek, only to realize that the dim lighting won't do the delicious food any justice. Sometimes you accept defeat, but sometimes the situation calls for some improv, which brings me to my next struggle.\nIf you encounter the struggle listed in number one, it may be time to call in back up. Eating with friends means you have impromptu lighting and prop services at your disposal. Don't pretend like you haven't had a few friends shine their phone lights on the dish so you can avoid the dreaded food-flash.\nIt's time to convince your friends that a good photo is worth the anticipation of being able to look (but not touch) their meals. Everybody gets to eat once you've got the Insta-worthy pic. The angry glares are worth it when you think about the shower of Instagram likes you'll get later.\nSometimes sacrifices need to be made for the perfect lighting. It may be chilly or windy, but if the lighting is on point, you'll be sitting on the patio to take those photos (at least until the food comes). No shame. That counts as appreciating the \"great outdoors\" right?\nOften times, unfortunately, that dish everybody has been raving about is the most expensive. Maybe the most Insta-worthy item on the menu isn't the one you really wanted to order. But if you're trying to promote what the restaurant is notorious for, it calls for some compromising.\nThe struggle can get very real, but it's worth it in the end. Being able to try countless dishes while advising the Instagram world on the what's-what in the foodie community is an experience like no other. Give your local foodie accounts a follow and show them some love; you never know what went on behind the scenes to get that perfect photo."

        "text": "Strategy is highly important for organisational success and the achievement of competitive advantage. Strategy is dynamic and it depends on accurate individual decision-making from medium and high-level managers and executives. Since managers always formulate strategy, its formulation depends mostly on their assertive decisions. Making good decisions is a complex task, even more in today’s business world where a large quantity of information and a dynamic environment forces people to decide without having complete information. As Shafir, Simonson, & Tversky (1993) point out, “the making of decisions, both big and small, is often difficult because of uncertainty and conflict”. In this paper the author will explain a basic theoretical framework about top manager’s individual decision-making, showing how complex the process of making high-impact decisions is; then, he will compare this theory with one of the most important streams in strategic management, the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm. Finally, within the context of individual decision-making and the RBV stream, the author will show how individual decision makers in top management positions constitute a valuable, rare, non-imitable and non-substitutable resource that provides sustained competitive advantage.\nExisting research into generational differences in Hungary was based primarily on adapting findings from studies undertaken in Western Countries. If we consider not only the comparative history and wealth but also the cultural differences between Hungary and the countries in which these studies took place, then the apparent adaptability is brought into question. This study aims to examine the nature of millennial students in Hungary by building up the characteristics from the ground up rather than adapting data from other countries. The findings of the pilot study indicate that the instrument is of suitable length and clarity, and that a printed format is the most likely to produce a high response rate, despite its disadvantages. The findings also confirm the results of previous studies concerning the preference of students in Hungary for a clan type of organisation. There are also initial indications that Hungarian millennials have a high potential for entrepreneurialism.\nToday’s business leaders must constantly review and develop their firm’s abilities to adapt to and benefit from external changes. Dynamic capabilities are the capacity of an organization to purposefully create, extend or modify its resource base. They enable it to exploit business, technological and market opportunities and adapt to market changes, an ability more often observed in highly dynamic industries, such as consumer electronics or telecommunications. Using the case study method, this article identifies dynamic capabilities in traditional, less dynamic industries when faced with a sudden drop of revenue. Four distinct routines emerge, namely structure and practices enduring time-sensitive strategic decision-making by the tice, and a culture encouraging learning and coevolving. Seemingly strategic paradox objectives encourage the management team to question the status quo and, when managed well, transform the tensions between old and new into an ability to advance superior ideas faster.\nBusiness angels are natural persons who provide equity financing for young enterprises and gain ownership in them. They are usually anonym investors and they operate in the background of the companies. Their important feature is that over the funding of the enterprises based on their business experiences they can contribute to the success of the companies with their special expertise and with strategic support. As a result of the asymmetric information between the angels and the companies their matching is difficult (Becsky-Nagy – Fazekas 2015), and the fact, that angel investors prefer anonymity makes it harder for entrepreneurs to obtain informal venture capital. The primary aim of the different type of business angel organizations and networks is to alleviate this matching process with intermediation between the two parties. The role of these organizations is increasing in the informal venture capital market compared to the individually operating angels. The recognition of their economic importance led many governments to support them. There were also public initiations that aimed the establishment of these intermediary organizations that led to the institutionalization of business angels. This study via the characterization of business angels focuses on the progress of these informational intermediaries and their ways of development with regards to the international trends and the current situation of Hungarian business angels and angel networks.\nStrategy has always been important for success. Whether strategy is applied for military purposes, in large firms, or even for personal objectives, there are certain key characteristics that every successful strategy carries on: clear, objective and simple goals; deep knowledge and understanding of the competitive environment; objective understanding and exploitation of resources; and an effective plan implementation. In this paper, the author’s attention will be focused on the role of internal resources, routines and processes as the bases of sustained competitive advantage (hereafter SCA) into what is now known as the resourcebased view of the firm (RBV) and Dynamic Capabilities (DC). First, the relevance of RBV and DC approaches and the main characteristics of those are briefly mentioned. Second, RBV and DC are examined as an important piece to achieve SCA. Later on, the author deepens into some examples and the manager’s importance when using these RBV and DC approaches. Then issues related with complexity and undefined concepts in RBV and DC are briefly mentioned. Finally, conclusions and personal comments are presented."

        "text": "Should Kids Lift Weights? By Brett Klika C.S.C.S.\nIn working with a large number of youth, this is one of the more common questions I get from concerned parents. Urban legends of stunted growth, fractured growth plates, and prematurely inflated physiques have made parents, and society for that matter, reticent to involve youth in weight training.\nThe fact is, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that there is a perfect chronological age to start weight training. Research has not demonstrated any negative health consequences for weight training in youth, assuming proper movement is introduced and enforced concurrently with appropriate progressive increases in training load.\nDespite what myths have been created around the subject, the current data suggests youth weight training injuries are primarily due to equipment accidents (weight falling on them, tripping in the weight room, etc.) or overzealous coaching rendering improper program introduction and progression.\nProper resistance training in youth has been demonstrated to improve fitness, favorably affect bone density, improve movement ability, and decrease the likelihood of athletic injury. Weight training is merely loaded movement. More simply put, it’s challenged movement. If basic movement becomes easy, we can challenge by adding something extra to continue to provide a training effect.\nIf a child can do a squat pattern perfectly for repetitions, holding a 2- pound medicine ball adds additional load. Once they can overcome this load with proper movement, they can hold a 4- pound ball. All semantic hubbub aside, this is weight training. One doesn’t have to be lifting barbells and dumbells to be training with weight. If a child can’t do a squat pattern perfectly, adding additional load would make no sense. They have demonstrated they do not need any additional challenge. The movement pattern itself has provided enough load.\n1. Are they able to focus on the proper execution of task?\n2. Are they able to execute and repeat an unloaded task with proper movement and cadence?\n3. Are they mature and coordinated enough to respond to coaching cues?\n4. Are they interested in weight training?\n5. Is the person in charge of their program experienced and knowledgeable about movement and progression?\nIf the answer to any of the above is “no” it doesn’t matter the age of the human, they are not ready for weight training. In this case, I would focus on merely learning how to move properly through a variety of movement patterns without additional challenge or load.\nThe best answer to “When should my child begin lifting weights” is “when they need to.” When a child is able to focus on an organized training in which they execute and repeat all of the involved skills and drills correctly, add a challenge and slowly progress over time.\nBrett Klika C.S.C.S., Director of Athletics at Fitness Quest 10 and founder of www.brettklika.com, is a world- renowned human performance specialist, motivational speaker, author, and educator. He uses this knowledge and experience to motivate individuals and audiences around the world through his writing, speaking, DVD’s, and personal correspondence. For more information and video on exercises, programs, and any other information on losing fat and creating the body you have always wanted, check out The Underground Workout Manual – Exercise and Fat Loss in the Real World at www.undergroundworkoutmanual.com.\nBefore resuming your exercise program post-delivery, always seek medical clearance from your doctor! It seems like there is always a new fitness trend promising quick and easy results. Do not fall for the marketing gimmicks! Stick to the fundamentals that have been proven to work.\nFor example, by exercising larger muscle groups you will burn more calories. Doing intervals is a great way to add intensity for even faster results. Walking each day is great exercise for both the mind and body.\nFinding time to exercise as a new mom can be tough! Your daily workouts can be included in the activities that you’re already doing by learning exercises that include your baby.\nSquats are tough on your thighs, and soothing for your baby. They can be done as you hold him or her against your chest and benefit you both. Exercises like pushups, plank, cat-cow, and bird-dog can be performed with your baby is lying underneath while giving them kisses and smiles. It’s a fun way to enjoy time together while also doing something good for you.\nInvest in inexpensive equipment for your home like a stability ball and resistance band. That way there is no excuse not workout when you can’t get to the gym.\nBuild slowly back to your pre-pregnancy fitness routine. Do not simply jump right back in to what you were doing before.\nIt is necessary to repair the deeper ab muscles that have been stretched first. Do not start with crunches. You can begin to rehab your abs with deep breathing exercises, plank, bridge, and pelvic tilt.\nIf you were a runner then start with walking and jogging before returning to running. If you lifted heavy weights, start lighter and do high repetitions.\nSimply going back to your old routine will do your body a disservice if you end up injured and can’t do anything at all.\nBe patient and nice to yourself. Don’t compare your body or weight loss to celebrities. It is not fair to measure yourself next to someone who probably has a full-time trainer and chef, and whose profession possibly requires them to be a size 2.\nRemember that it took 9 months to put the weight on, and to drop it overnight is not healthy or realistic. Steady, consistent exercise and weight loss is the best way to decrease fat and keep it off permanently.\nDo them! I can’t stress this enough. Keeping your pelvic muscles strong is often overlooked, but so important.\nTatum Rebelle is a pregnancy and new mom fitness and nutrition expert.

        "text": "In Arkansas, for-profit corporations must pay a franchise tax to keep its corporate charter. Essentially, a franchise tax is a \"privilege tax\" imposed on corporations and other business entities, including limited liability companies and other non-exempt companies, that transact business in Arkansas. Ark. Code Ann. 26-54-101, et seq. An example of a non-exempt company would be a non-profit corporation, a corporation that is exempt from federal income tax, or an organization formed pursuant to the Uniform Partnership Act (1996) or the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (2001). Ark. Code Ann. 26-54-102.\nAll franchise taxes and reports due for the prior year must be submitted by May 1st. Since the the 1st of the month falls on a Sunday this year, franchise taxes and from are due to the Arkansas Secretary of State by May 2, 2016. If the taxes are not timely paid, penalties will be levied and interest will accrue on the unpaid amounts, and the Secretary of State's office will change the corporation's status from being in \"good standing\" to \"not current.\"\nIf franchise taxes are still not paid by the end of the year, December 31, the corporation will lose its corporate charter on January 1. Ark. Code Ann. 26-54-111. A corporate charter can be reinstated, but not until all franchise taxes, interest, and penalties are paid. There are serious consequences to losing the corporate charter. The Arkansas Court of Appeals once held that officers and directors of a corporation who actively participated in the operation of the corporation during the time when the corporate charter was revoked for failure to pay franchise taxes were individually liable for debts incurred during the period of revocation. Larzelere v. Reed, 35 Ark. App. 174, 816 S.W.3d 614 (1991).\nIf the corporation is no longer doing business, it must formally dissolve to avoid the accruing of interest and additional franchise taxes for future years. Prior to dissolution, the Secretary of State requires that any outstanding taxes, interest and penalties be paid. The Secretary of State has a lien on all of the corporation's property until the amounts due are fully paid. Ark. Code Ann. 26-54-107. Corporate dissolution must occur before January 1 to avoid additional franchise tax liability for the previous year."

        "text": "A brief overview of how computers, more specifically ICT, have changed over the past half a century is presented. Decades ago, when Gunilla Bradley began investigating the use of computer systems from a psychosocial perspective, ICT was used predominantly in the work environment, particularly for data capturing. Systems were designed for the workplace. Since then computer technology has changed significantly expanding to private and social use as well as for entertainment and communication. This chapter is about the history and development of ICT of which Bradley was a part. Now, at the end of her career, ICT will move beyond social aspects. The question is: what is next? - especially as workplace metaphors are still used for interface design. I propose that the human aspect should be the next dominant focus of attention, which implies a redesign of systems in order to reduce task load, effort and stress. This proposal is founded on a techno-utilitarian philosophy.\nWhen Gunilla Bradley began investigating the use of computer systems from a psychosocial perspective in the late 1960s, computers were used only in large organisations such as the military, government and corporations. The “market” covered was a small proportion of possible populations. Computers at that stage were number crunching machines, predominantly used for calculations and basic record keeping. Bradley's work naturally could only focus on the work environment, as computers were initially not used for other purposes yet.\nHer interest was not so much on the computer engineering or technician side -- i.e. the white-coats who managed computers in “secret” locations inaccessible except for the initiates -- but on the end-users: the data capturing clerks in typing pools. She considered their reactions to the work environment, and later defined psychosocial as “the process involving the interaction between the objective environment and the subjective one.” (2006:51).\nComputer technology has changed significantly since the 1960s, not only technically, but also regarding their use by humans. In her summary (chapter 3 in 2006) of developments in computing the focus is more on technological changes, such as miniaturization and chip innovations, but she does not neglect interface improvements and home entertainment technology (e.g. chapter 5 in 2006). My own summary presented here of the relatively short history of computers does not focus so much on the technological history than on the human and social aspects.\nThe first generations of devices were computers used for military and business purposes. Some later generations were networked. In large organisations there was a server with workstations on individuals' desks. All the computing power was on the server, and the terminals basically dumb display and input units. When the computing power was transferred to the terminal, which could now operate by itself, even without network connection, it was called a “personal computer” (the PC), which is a misnomer, as there was nothing personal about it - its main function was still office work, as demonstrated by the metaphors used for the interface: files, directories, and the name of the first general application “word processing”, on which I will elaborate below.\nWith reference to computing power, the PC was actually a down-scaled computer, but it could operate on its own, independent of the server or network. The first PC's were, to put it crudely, just powerful typewriters, and the purpose of typing was creating documents for business and organisational purposes. Academics began writing books and articles on PCs, just as they previously did with typewriters. Later generations of PCs would have the added advantage of re-use of such documents, when copying sections of text became easier, but that was not possible with the early generation of PCs.\nOnly from the 1990s did the PC became more “personal”, as more application software products came on the market that were not primarily work-related. Entertainment products, particularly games, grew phenomenally, so that by the turn of the century the gaming industry surpassed the movie industry in financial turnover. The internet moved into the public domain, and especially the World Wide Web brought an immense digital library into middle-class homes, as well as facilitating communication by means of email. Just after the turn of the century, social networking tools were introduced that made networked communication even easier, as well as including multimedia functionality. At the time of writing some of the most popular online applications are tools focusing on the social aspects of human nature - Facebook, blogs, and twitter.\nThe brief history of computing, stretching over just half a century, thus saw extending its range of relevance from the workplace to homes, from formal office administration to entertainment and informal social activities, from restricted in-house network connectivity to informal global networks. Castells (2004a) and Giddens (1983) have somewhat different takes on technology and society, but they agree that ICT are social enablers. Despite these changes that penetrated society at large, and extended use to include many more and diverse social groups, human interaction models with the virtual world of information are still held hostage by workplace metaphors, by convoluted applications, and in short, by immature interfacing with the machinery of computers."

        "text": "‎Suzanne Tyrpak,Thanks for your interest in our \"On The Spot Interview\", as the great William Talcott has named it recently, if I ask you what would you like to read in a book, our members may be able to guess what and how you would like to write, and please, before our members start guessing about the genre you would love to write, you might want to tell us about it, we would love to hear about your works, and your interests in the world of writing, are you a published author, tell us where can we buy your books?\nSuzanne Tyrpak I love reading books that hook me in from the beginning with a question or dilemma--some kind of mystery that draws me through the story. For me, a good story contains an element of mystery.\nSuzanne Tyrpak And I enjoy learning about something when I read: another time and place, something scientific, something fascinating. I've published two novels and two short story collections. Here's my author page on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/Suzanne-Tyrpak/e/B003ZTP0J4/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1 Sorry--the last post got away from me!\nShah Sight Thanks, do you want to tell us a little bit about your novels, what are the stories about, just in a few lines, please?\nSuzanne Tyrpak That said, two of my fave authors of all time are Jane Austen and D.H. Lawrence.\nSuzanne Tyrpak I write historical suspense, and my stories feature strong women. I like to explore the roles of women, and recreate lost history. Vestal Virgin--suspense in ancient Rome is the story of a Vestal Virgin who faces the Roman Emperor, Nero--a sociopath bent on destroying her family. Hetaera--suspense in ancient Athens is the story of a slave girl who becomes a courtesan (hetaera). The hetaera were literate, powerful, and had more freedom than most Athenian women.\nSuzanne Tyrpak The plural of hetaera is hetaerae!\nShah Sight Suzanne, very interesting, were you so young when you started writing, what made you chose writing historical suspense, what motivated you, is there any kind of connection between how you lived or worked and how you write?\nSuzanne Tyrpak My major in college was classic theater with a focus on Greek theater and ancient religions. My mom was a children's librarian, and she got me interested in mythology at a young age. My interest continued after being introduced to classic Greek theater; I was an actress for awhile, and the characters for women were wonderfully dramatic! Guess I've always been a bit of a drama queen!!!\nShah Sight Suzanne, you definitely are a drama queen, let me ask you something away from your work, and this is our last question for you today, I am from Afghanistan, and unfortunately women in our country suffer a lot, of course you have been thinking about those women a lot in your life, what are your thoughts about them, I think they have nothing in their life to enjoy, how much do you know and what do you want to say to us?\nSuzanne Tyrpak I have thought about the women in Afghanistan a lot, and my heart goes out to them. Throughout history there have been times when women have been oppressed. Despite that oppression, women continue to play a major role in life. After all, the species can't continue without us! I want those women to know that though they may feel helpless, though they may feel unheard--many people are aware of their situation and their pain. Their cries are heard, and echo throughout the world--echo through our collective consciousness. The internet is a great thing, and words are powerful. I pray things will change for the women of Afghanistan, and all oppressed women. When I heard about pharaonic circumcision I was so appalled that I wrote a novel about it--as of yet it's unpublished, but I will do something with it. When I shopped the book around, no one wanted to hear about it. But people must learn about this horrendous mutilation. Knowledge is the first step toward change, and I believe change is possible. Women's voices must be heard.\nShah Sight Thank you, Suzanne, if I tell you that your words brought tears in my eyes, you should believe me, and I am sure every word in your novels is as powerful as your answers here in this interview, it was a real joy for us to have you on our site, today.\nSuzanne Tyrpak Thank you, Shah. It's a pleasure to meet you. You're in a position to help many women. And I feel sure you will. Please let me know how I can help. May all beings be free from suffering."

        "text": "Puerto Morelos, the typical Mexican fishing village in Quintana Roo has lots going for it. One of the main attractions is the second largest barrier reef in the world, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, which lies just offshore. In 1998 this section of the reef was declared a protected National Marine Park. As a result, it’s less visited, healthier and more spectacular than the reef near Playa del Carmen and Cancun. We learnt about the reef and snorkelling in Puerto Morelos soon after arriving in the village. It was instantly added to our list of things to do. After all, there was no way we could live in Puerto Morelos for six weeks and miss out on that.\nAt first, we hoped to snorkel the reef from the shore independently but it seemed it was prohibited due to the reefs protected status. The only way to snorkel the reef was with an accredited guide and always wearing a life jacket or snorkel vest. After looking at several tours to take us to snorkel the reef (both with agencies in town and independent guides on the beach) we decided to take a Classic Reef Tour with Wet Set Diving Adventures.\nWet Set Diving Adventures provided us with a complimentary Reef Snorkel Tour which I’ve reviewed below. Read more in our full Product Review Disclosure.\nWet Set Diving Adventures is owned by Canadians, Stafford and Jewal. It’s the longest standing, most popular and highly rated dive and snorkel tour company in Puerto Morelos. The tour company was set up in 1997 just before the reef became protected. It was the first ever PADI dive shop in the village and has held the TripAdvisor top position for ‘things to do’ in Puerto Morelos since 2012.\nAll the Wet Set Diving Adventure team are trained and certified in diving, snorkelling and the appropriate safety precautions; they are also educated in low-impact tourism. Wet Set is an ethical, eco-friendly tour operator that strives to have as little environmental impact as possible.\nPuerto Morelos snorkel and dive tours with Wet Set start at their shop which is located on a side street just two minutes from the beach. The tours have a prompt start so we arrived a few minutes early to meet our two guides and the rest of the small group on the tour – eight of us. After completing a short disclaimer form, we were given a bottle of water and kitted out with fins, life jacket, mask and snorkel. We were also given the opportunity to rinse off any insect repellent and sunscreen as it can be very damaging to the reef. You really don’t want to get sunburnt so it’s a good idea to use biodegradable sunscreen if you’re snorkelling on a hot, sunny day.\nIf you’d prefer to come armed with your own snorkel gear, then My Favourite Escapes has some great advice on how to choose your own snorkel gear and Dive In recommends best snorkel fins.\nOnce we had our snorkel gear and our bags were safely stashed in the dive shop we walked down to the beach, where a motorboat was waiting. It was called Jaguar 2 and was jaguar print, waiting on board were our two captains. The boat bobbed about on the sparkling turquoise sea with a flock of seagulls perched atop of the awning. Not far offshore, we could see the waves breaking over the reef! Eager to get started we paddled to the boat and clambered on board as the seagulls flapped noisily away.\nOne of our English speaking guides told us some history about Puerto Morelos, the reef and the chicle (chewing gum) trade. This was peppered with jokes and ‘pop quizzes’ which kept us laughing and entertained. He gave us a safety briefing and instructions on how to use a mask, snorkel and fins. He also explained how to snorkel responsibly by not touching anything and avoiding damaging the reef with our fins. We’ve snorkelled many times before but this overview was great for the first timers and inexperienced snorkellers in our group and put them at ease. It was was by far the best briefing we’ve ever had on a snorkel tour. Generally, you’re just told to follow your guide and that’s it.\nWe’d arrived at our first snorkel site by the time the briefing and instructions were finished. It only took about ten minutes max but remember the reef is very close to the shore. In fact, it’s probably swimmable for good swimmers if it wasn’t banned in the rules and regulations of the protected reef.\nWe had around 90 minutes snorkel time in total split equally across two sites – Radio Pirata and Labyrinth. We saw a spotted an eagle ray, barracuda, grouper, angelfish, a big lobster and a huge array of other different sized fish in a kaleidoscope of colours.\nOf course, I shouldn’t forget to mention the fantastic array of beautiful, healthy coral, anemones, ferns and urchins. Our guides knew all the good spots to take us and accompanied the group at all times, pointing out the best sealife to make sure we didn’t miss anything.\nOur favourite sighting has to be the spotted eagle ray which we saw “flying” gracefully past us early on at the first site. I wasn’t so keen on the vicious looking barracudas which made me nervous. They like sparkly things so luckily I’d removed my jewellery beforehand. We’d hoped to see a turtle as there are often sightings in the area but that day we were unlucky. We did spot one a couple of weeks later swimming near seagrass just offshore.\nOur favourite site of the day was Labyrinth, it was so much fun exploring and navigating the network of channels between the coral. We found it a little challenging due to a slight current, but nothing we couldn’t handle and our guides were there ready to help if needed.\nBack on the boat after the first site, we were given another bottle of water and a granola bar. We thought this a nice touch and a welcome energy boost ready for the second site.\nAfter the second dive, we headed back to the dive shop to rinse the gear off in fresh water. We also had the opportunity to take a shower and dry off with the big, clean beach towels that Wet Set provided. We then enjoyed some fresh fruit and water whilst we hung around for a while chatting about our snorkel trip.\nBefore we left Andy and I had a quick look round the small shop as I needed a new mask and snorkel to replace mine that had broken months ago . There was a good selection and ‘Carly’, who was working in the shop was really helpful. Eventually, a few weeks later I returned to buy their ‘house’ mask and snorkel. They were the same type we’d had on the tour and cost $35 USD (£24.90) for both which was good value. I’ve used it a couple of times since and it’s the best snorkel equipment I’ve had to date.\nThe price of a snorkel tour with Wet Set Diving Adventures depends on which one you do. There are five different tours which you can view the detail of on their website. They range in price from $35 USD (£25 GBP) for the Classic Snorkel Tour that we did all the way to $199 (£142 GBP) for the Whale Shark Snorkelling Tour (July/ August only). The tours aren’t the cheapest you’ll find in Puerto Morelos but they’re still very reasonable. In our opinion, the fantastic tour and customer service you receive is well worth the extra few dollars.\nWe were impressed with our snorkel tour with Wet Set Diving Adventures and loved every minute of it. The friendly, knowledgeable guides, history and information, safety briefing, high-quality equipment and the wonderful snorkelling made it one of our favourite experiences in Puerto Morelos.\nNote: After our tour, Wet Set told us that it is possible to snorkel from the beach, but only in a designated roped area, not out on the reef. Whilst this is worth doing if you have time (it’s where we saw the turtle), we’d recommend doing a reef tour first where the snorkelling is even better.\nHave you snorkelled on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef near Puerto Morelos or somewhere else? How was your experience and what did you see?\nProduct Review Disclosure: Wet Set Diving Adventures provided us with a complimentary Classic Reef Snorkel Tour. This did not influence my post in any way and as always I’ve provided a balanced and honest review. Read more in our full Product Review Disclosure.\nWhat an incredible day trip, thanks for sharing it, it absolutely looks worth taking a trip onto the Reef rather than snorkelling off the beach! I loved your photo of the spotted eagle ray, what an amazing shot.\nThank you – yes it was a great trip. The beach snorkelling was good too, but the reef was excellent!\nLove this post! Looks like a great snorkelling tour!"

Starting at GHS 7.5, you can own some shares. However, to make a profit from the shares, you need to invest some more. Also, when MTN’s shares increase in value, the value of the money you invested in the shares goes up.

We will enjoy a cocktail hour with appetizers, followed by dinner, dessert, and time to socialize with your crewmates away from the ships! Purchase your tickets here.\nThe Guild was informed last year that Pier 9 was being developed into public space, newly named Cherry Street Pier. The Guild relied on free use of Pier 9, which is owned by the Delaware River Waterfront Corporation, to store wood and equipment used in the maintenance of Gazela and Jupiter. Luckily, Holt Logistics generously donated 3 year lease on a 10,000 sq ft lot near the airport for our stuff. The Guild will have to build shelters for the wood piles, but at least there is now space for storing the existing timbers and all material being gathered for the next rebuild.\nOur storage containers were moved down on December 5, 2017 thanks to Rob’s Towing of Bristol. On December 13, our volunteers loaded two truckloads of big timbers from Pier 9 plus two truckloads of wood stored at the Navy Yard. River Services donated their staff and forklift to load at the Navy Yard. And a crack team of volunteers unloaded in a driving cold wind. We have scheduled Monday December 18 for the last two loads to be picked up at the Navy Yard and delivered to the lot.\nBring a dish. Bring a bottle. Bring a friend and turn them on to the ship. Please email volunteer@gazela.org and let us know if you can help by bringing a big pot of something to eat or help with set-up or clean-up.\nFor those of you who are new to our little band of sailors and are looking forward to getting underway this season, we are offering sail training classes this spring.\nPlease register for one of the classes at this link.\nThis class, provided at no cost only to active Guild members, covers a variety of basic topics ranging from knot tying, line handling, learning the ship, emergency stations and watchstanding roles. For new members, you will receive a copy of the Gazela crew manual, a log book, and a complimentary piece of rope for knot tying.\nOn Wednesday, 29 July, Gazela entered Dry Dock No. 2 at Rhoads Industries in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She crossed the sill at 0805, followed by the barge Poplar, and the water was pumped out beginning at 0955; at about 1230 she touched the blocks.\nThis is the first time the ship has been hauled out in ten years and the first time the barge has been hauled out in probably twice that time. Once the dry dock was pumped out, the scaffolding was built around Gazela.\nDuring the week of 3 August, workers and volunteers began taking off the copper and inspecting Gazela‘s framing and wood under the copper. After the copper was off, we began removing selected planks, which was accomplished with chainsaws, chisels, pry bars, clamps, big wooden levers, and plenty of teamwork.\nThe condition of the framing under these planks is better than we had expected, which is quite promising. We also started work on the thru-hull fittings, which will include replacing plastic fittings with copper or other material, and on removing the zincs (sacrificial anodes) that will soon be replaced with new ones.\nWith the planks removed, work started on prepping the ship for new planking (cleaning up seams, reefing seams, cleaning between the hull planking and the ceiling planking, etc.); in addition to this, the shipwrights began the process of roughly shaping the planking stock so that when the patterns are made they will be easier to cut.\nDuring week three, we worked simultaneously on documentation, inspection, minor repairs to plank edges, and plank prep. There was spiling (using the space that the plank will go in to work up a pattern to make a new plank), cutting, steaming, and fastening, and by the end of the week we got the first plank of the project in and got another ready to steam.\nWith about fourteen more planks to make, we have a planer to get them to the proper thickness, after which the shipwrights will cut them to shape based on the patterns that they have made for each plank.\nGetting the shape and size of each plank is critical, as they all have very specific places in the ship where they have to precisely fit. After the planks are put into the ship in the coming weeks, we will be putting copper back on.\nDuring the first week, we started with chipping rust and power washing the hull, and we also removed the sole boards on the port and starboard side in order to clean up those spaces and inspect them.\nIn week two, we continued the rust chipping and moved all of the combustibles off the barge in preparation for hot work. We also began needle-gunning in order to further eliminate rust (and to try to make more holes in the hull, since this is our chance to fix them) and continued removing things that need to be removed/moved.\nWe continued the prepping of the barge for hot work during week three, and with all of the concrete and rust removed from the bow and stern rakes, we began the removal of bad steel in those areas and cleaning up the hull in preparation for welding and painting."

I normally have a hard time with books told in a male POV and narrated by a guy, but this actually worked very well for me! Thanks so much for gifting me a copy, Melissa.\nWe quickly dive right into the story by meeting some of the grotesques, think gargoyles but don't ever call them that. The first bit of the story is told in Mordecai aka Morty's POV and we learn that the grotesques and the few remaining humans that aren't possessed are holed up in a cathedral. They're hiding from the demons that possessed humans who plan on taking over the world. With more and more sanctuaries falling under the demons sieges, theirs winds up being the last one standing. While the first half of the book is us learning about the day to day lives in the sanctuary, the last half is full of action. The demons want to take over and plan on taking down their cathedral by force. With the battle brewing, the humans and grotesques have to try their hardest to beat the hordes of demons any way they can.\nStone Cold Bastards is a unique read that had me rooting for the underdogs. The characters were engaging and while they could be a bit crass it suited their situation well. The world reminded me a bit of The Walking Dead as I was listening, though the demons are able to talk, fire a gun, etc. While the story does cycle through several different POVs it was easy to distinguish what was going on and who was narrating at any given time. All in all, this was a really good read that I'd recommend if you like edgy, end of the world type reads.\nGreat title for a book on gargoyles.\nSo many gargoyle books!!! This has to be a new thing. I'm seeing so much of them lately. Demons vs. gargoyles sounds interesting. Any romance in this one?\nI love gargoyles - my friend from Deanna's World got me hooked on them. I will have to tell her about this book! Good review.\nStopping by from Bambi Unbridled for #getsocial2017.\nOooh I'll have to check out her page and see what else she recommends!!\nI just love that title, haha!\nGargoyles are awesome, and yes you don't see them that much? Like the sound of this one.\nI have never read a gargoyles book before. I don't mind male POV it can be fun I think.\nhmmmmmm, I may have to check this out!\nYea! So glad you enjoyed it!

        "text": "When you are ready to purchase your first aquarium, one of the first things you learn is how to properly cycle the aquarium and how to slowly introduce new fish to avoid ammonia spikes while the colonies of beneficial bacteria are developing. That's easy enough to follow -- but what about when you have to move an existing community of fish to a new home? Maybe you moved and have to re-establish the aquarium, maybe you're moving to a larger or even a smaller tank; whatever the reason, there are ways to safely move the fish without as much risk of ammonia spikes.\nA properly cycled tank contains a healthy colony of bacteria that breaks down ammonia from a fish's waste and uneaten food into nitrites and then into nitrates. In a healthy tank, there should be 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites and less than 40ppm nitrates (20ppm if you have invertebrates such as snails or shrimp). Without sufficient amounts of beneficial bacteria, ammonia and nitrite in the water may be fatal to fish.\nBeneficial bacteria live all through the water and on every underwater surface in the aquarium, but the water itself carries a very low concentration of bacteria so it's not very effective to simply transfer water from the old aquarium to the new in order to maintain bacteria levels. Ideally, you will be able to transfer some old filter media to the new aquarium, or even a handful of gravel or fake plants that will all have beneficial bacteria on them. Make sure that the materials of your choice stay wet with tank water until they can be placed in the new aquarium.\nAlternatively, if you have EcoBio-Stone products in your aquarium, that will be sufficient to switch over to the new one. EcoBio-Block has a lot of beneficial bacteria living in its volcanic rock and has quite a bit of surface area so a lot of additional bacteria get transferred over from the established tank. It is not necessary to keep EcoBio-Block wet, but it may help eliminate any minor ammonia spikes that may occur after the transfer as there will be more active bacteria immediately if kept wet. EcoBio-Block will also allow you to wait a little bit longer before doing the first water change as it provides essential minerals that would otherwise have to be replenished through water changes, giving the fish extra time to de-stress after a big move without being bothered.\nMake sure not to put whatever bacteria-containing materials you've chosen into the new aquarium until a de-chlorinator has been used in the water as chlorine will kill the bacteria. Keep close tabs on the water parameters for the first week after the transfer, doing minor water changes as needed to compensate for any ammonia in the system that may not be compensated for by the bacteria yet. Watch the fish closely for any clamped fins or red, puffy gills as these may be signs that the water parameters are off. If these simple guidelines are followed your fish should have a relatively effortless and healthy move."

In the wake of the celebration of her 60 years as British monarch, Trevor McDonald offers viewers a look at the customs surrounding the monarchy - from the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace to the Queen's royal visits - and a glimpse of the greatest historic royal places.\nArlington, Va. - June 15, 2012 - PBS Distribution today announced it is releasing Queen & Country on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2012, all eyes are on Queen Elizabeth II, Britain's second longest-reigning monarch, as England marks her Diamond Jubilee. In the wake of the celebration of her 60 years as British monarch, Trevor McDonald's Queen & Country offers viewers a look at the customs surrounding the monarchy - from the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace to the Queen's royal visits - and a glimpse of the greatest historic royal places. Queen & Country will be available on DVD and Blu-ray July 24, 2012. The run time of the program is 240 minutes and it comes on two discs. The DVD SRP is $29.99 and the Blu-ray SRP is $34.99.\n\"It has been remarkable to observe how the Queen has been able to update this remarkable institution with a modern face with such dignity and grace and charm,\" said McDonald. \"If anything, it has made the monarchy a much more solid institution than we ever thought it could be.\"\nThis series contains four programs. Each of the four programs is described below.\nLondon is, indisputably, the capital of Britain's royal life. Here, the young Princess Elizabeth grew up before World War II. Here she and her sister, Margaret, mingled, incognito, with the joyous crowds on VE Day. Here, she was crowned queen at the age of 26 after the death of her father, King George. Join Sir Trevor McDonald as he introduces us to the ongoing traditions of the monarchy in London, from members of the Grenadier Guards, the Scots Guards of Buckingham Palace and the Horse Guards and to the opening of the Parliament by the Queen.\nThe Queen's year is driven by her diary - and has been since her accession in 1952. See her in Scotland at the Braemar Gathering (which she has attended 70 times) and follow her on a visit to Liverpool - the sort of regional trip that is considered a great honor by the small city. And, we see that in 1953, filmmakers endeavored to shoot unique 3D footage, which is now held by the British Film Institute.\nThe Queen has some surprising possessions. Among them are Westminster Abbey, the Royal Swans and the Chapels Royal. These are \"peculiars of the crown\" - as are the Tower of London, which is part of a collection of Historic Royal Places, and the Tower of London ravens - it's rumored that if they ever left, the tower would fall. The Queen also owns the Channel Islands, where islanders still call Her Majesty the Duke of Normandy to remind outsiders that they were on the winning side with William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. Not forgetting the Royal Collection - to which she has added nearly 150 portraits over the past six decades - follow the process used to create one of the most unusual.\nThe queen is head of the 16 realms that make up the Commonwealth. In Perth, Western Australia, Queen Elizabeth is on tour before opening the Heads of Government Meeting, which is especially important for the monarchy. The Commonwealth countries are being asked to change the rules of succession so that a first-born girl may inherit the crown. If approved, it will be the single biggest change to the monarchy for centuries. At the age of 85, the queen remains undaunted by long-haul travel - as this program shows.\nTrevor McDonald's \"QUEEN & COUNTRY\" is presented by Trevor McDonald OBE. Producer and Director is Alastair Layzell. For Sky 3D: Production Executive is Sarah Needham. Executive Producer is Benedetta Pinelli. For History: Executive Producers are Rachel Job and Sarah Proctor. For THIRTEEN: Executive in charge is Stephen Segaller. Executive Producer is Julie Anderson. Supervising Producer is Stephanie Carter. Production Assistant is Rachel Hartman.\nFunding for Queen & Country is provided by public television viewers.\nQueen & Country is a Colonial Pictures Production for Sky 3D, History and THIRTEEN in association with WNET. WNET is the parent company of THIRTEEN and WLIW21, New York's public television stations and operator of NJTV.

This was especially interesting after reading a blog post from Educational Origami about what age was appropriate for children to be using social networking.\nIn the article we are seeing technology being used in early childhood centres in a way that promotes both education and exercise. The Nintendo Wii is a very useful piece of technology that can get kids moving, especially in the wet winter days that we are getting at the moment. My sister, who lives in Australia, bought a Nintendo Wii for her children for this reason – keeping her kids active during the very hot summer days where it is sometimes better to stay inside an air-conditioned room. I must admit, that right now I would love for our family to have a Wii, as our kids are getting a bit crazy with all this rain! Of course the other good aspect of the Nintendo Wii at this age is that it helps build motor skills and hand-eye coordination.\nThe kids were using Skype also to video call other kindergarten children around the world! Well, in my view that is absolutely fantastic! The kids are getting a grasp of technology, able to learn about other cultures, countries and possibly languages. They get to meet new and different people and getting to make at least a little sense of the world!\nAll of this interaction is being closely monitored and it needs to be. As the article suggests there are critics of these schemes however we really do need to look at both sides of the situation. There is some good teaching and learning to be done with this technology. I would certainly be happy for my children to be experiencing this sort of learning at kindergarten or school. And just like everything, it needs to be balanced. It should not totally replace other activities.\nOne bonus for educators in primary and secondary schools is that the students themselves will already have started to learn about cyber safety and privacy.\nEducation early childhood, learning, technology Bookmark the permalink.\nI agree that these are wonderful opportunities for students at young ages. I have taught Pre- K for 3 years and I have struggled with finding appropriates uses of technology in my classroom. I absolutely love the idea of being able to Skype someone in another state or country, this would be a great thing to do if a class had pen pals in other schools. I would have never thought of that. I do not know of anyone who has used a Wii in their classroom but I think it would be a great tool for a PE teacher or Occupational therapist to reach those students who might not otherwise participate in physical activities to promote hand eye coordination and small muscle control. Thanks for sharing and I will pass the ideas along to my co-workers.\nThanks for your comment. I currently teach in distance education and have not used a Wii in the classroom, however I do use Skype with my students as it’s a great way to get a more face-to-face interaction with them. Skyping with pen pals is a great idea!"

The $5.8 million project has been funded primarily by private donations to Forest Park Forever.\n\"This Central Fields project has been on our list for many years, so we are excited about moving into the construction phase,” Greg Hayes, director of the city's Parks, Recreation & Forestry division, said in a release. “We have a fantastic project design that will greatly improve the experience of visitors enjoying an array of activities, from sports to concerts to festivals. Next year will mark an exciting new chapter for this iconic area of Forest Park.\"\nWith Central Fields undergoing the makeover this year and next, both the Great Forest Park Balloon Race and LouFest are temporarily moving to new locations, with the former held at Art Hill and the latter at the Upper Muny's Festival & Parking Plaza.\nThe renovation is part of a multi-year phase of improvement projects in Forest Park."

        "text": "Positive affirmations can help us raise our vibrations into activating changes in the brain which release negative thought patterns, making room for spiritual transformations of the miraculous kind. They create an energy all their own. Affirming words, thoughts and actions give us the miraculous ability to raise the frequency of thought to change the body, mind and soul into healing action and manifestation.\nWhen thoughts are repeated, they become beliefs. Belief brings in our reality. As we have formed thought patterns which do not serve us well as we go about our lives, we must form new ones to replace those we have decided to let go.\nHow do I heal this with your guidance by incorporating higher knowledge?\nDuring meditation speak with your guides and loved ones intuitively and out loud. Listen and see through your third eye vision the words, people, places, things that will be providing these answers. Breathe in your affirmations and feel their energy flow through all your chakra centers. Courage takes practice.\nRemember that peace is an energy. You are the creator. In most situations you have time to make a choice. Is this my circus? Are these thoughts coming from my true self or of those around me? Through choosing affirmation you can intuit the path to take at that time without letting the doubt and anxiety change what you know is really true for you. It may take you out of your comfort zone but that could be a very good thing!\nAnytime that stress brings in these little voices, use your big inside voice to quiet them down. Write, speak, pray, meditate, walk, sing, dance and affirm to release and renew. Affirmations should be a part of your everyday life like brushing your teeth. Your quality of life depends on your thoughts. No matter how rich, poor, challenged or blessed you are, your thoughts create your reality.\nAs you would never approve of someone bullying another, you should never bully yourself by agreeing to negative thoughts about yourself. Their sources are varied but their voices are destructive in the same way.\nThe purpose of affirmation is self-improvement and spiritual connection. They should always clear as something that can heal or manifest. It should never be an untrue statement. The subconscious will start to believe the lie which in turn could truly damage your mental state. Instead of concentrating on lack of anything, concentrate on creating abundance and gratefulness. I am Grateful means that you have gratitude for life itself and as long as you are alive, there is something waiting to be discovered, explored, and manifested.\nSelf-talk can change your entire life setting and attitude if the frequency is set on positive reinforcement. You will let in the forces of metaphysical miracles when the mind can understand there really are endless possibilities in human evolution of the mind’s consciousness. How incredible is this tool that we are really only now beginning to understand through science and belief. If you are endless, and boundless in spirit then you are able to exist way beyond these physical bodies which we are also only just beginning to realize how to keep alive.\nThrough our diets, beliefs and physical motion these bodies will begin lasting much longer than ever and the mind will expand in its ability to heal. Crossing over will mean walking through to the higher dimensions without leaving our physical bodies at all. Our souls survive. We can always choose to incarnate or live as pure consciousness. In knowing that and reminding ourselves of it through affirming our ongoing existence, we give ourselves a glorious gift of peace.\nReaching that higher ground in an emotional flood becomes a practice that helps to bring in a thriving and growing lifestyle in affirmation of life. We may only be here a set number of years right now in these lifetimes, while we are here and alive, we have purpose and meaning. So do the words you speak to yourself every day. Make sure they are filled with unconditional love and understanding for all you have been and all you are learning to be. Make sure they are sprinkled with forgiveness and humor. Know all you have learned so far is setting you free. You are always in charge. Your thoughts and no one else’s are all you need to affirm how magnificent in soul you really are."

        "text": "Apple cider is good too, just a tablespoon with water twice a day will cut the flu symptoms.\nHere is tried and true, souther flu-kicking remedy. Drinking this when I first start to feel sick, kicks the virus out. If taken during cold or flu recovery, helps ease congestion and prevents cough.\n8 oz of hot water, 2 Tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 jigger whiskey, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 2 shakes of cayenne pepper. Stir and drink slowly. Enjoy.\nI don't usually have fresh ginger on hand, but do right now. I have been using it in a warm apple cider vinegar drink. So tasty!\nMix together in a larger mug or to go coffee mug to keep you cozy when you go out in the cold.\nI think I would especially love this if I had a cold or the flu.\nBy the way, after I finish the drink, I chew on the pieces of ginger in the bottom of the mug. One at a time. Great when you have the munchies.\nMtM, I just put too much ginger in my smoothie. It tastes spicy but I figure it can't harm now that the cold is setting in.\nI have to share a wonderful remedy that provided immediate relief and nipped my flu/cold/sore throat or whatever I was coming down with immediately.\nIn a blender, blend an entire bulb of raw garlic (I know lol that's alot! ), a huge slice of ginger, 3 tablespoons of raw organic honey, a tablespoon of organic cayenne pepper, 4 tablespoons of organic apple cider vinegar with mothers, 1 lemon squeezed, 2 cups of water.\nDrink a sip of this special concoction every few hours (sip at first to make sure your stomach can handle it, and drink more if you can! ). This brought immediate relief to whatever I had going on! I am pretty healthy and typically I have other protocols that I employ (organic supplements), but this year, I am super passionate about using \"whole real foods\" for my body so that's why I tried this. My only warning is that you will reek/smell like garlic for at least two days, but I was so amazed at how quickly this worked that I had to share this remedy!\nWhile I am a firm believer in the healing abilities of ACV, I must admit this time that it couldn't overcome my flu. The flu already had a 3+ day head start, I was taking 2 tablespoons of the highly known brand of ACV, along with a tablespoon of locally produced honey in 6 ozs of distilled water.\nWhile this combo would knock out the side effects for approx. 2 hours, the flu fought back each time to the level of intensity that had been there previously. I did this 3 times a day, same results each time. Finally had no choice but to go to the doctor getting Tamiflu and a Z pack.\nWhile I haven't read thru all the posts, from this experience maybe because I didn't start early enough this was too little too late. I for one will continue with the ACV in the future.\nWas the water hot when you added it? Hot water or very warm water destroys the healing properties in both ACV and honey.\nI have not had the flu in years and my first day on vacation I started getting the flu symtoms. I immediately pulled up EC website to find a natural remedy, I started taking 2 tablespoons of ACV 3x a day for 3 days. I started feeling better after the first day. ACV & Virgin Coconut oil are my go to natural remedies . This site is amazing!!!! Thank you so much!!\nI am amazed at how good it works. I have been on this site for 2 illnesses and both were cured with ACV. Old school cures do work! There are healing properties in both ACV and raw honey. Why suffer huh? Spread the news to your friends is my new motto.\nI’ve also been seeing a lot of improvement using one teaspoon of ACV in 6oz of warm water with a few lemon, honey, and menthol lozenges dissolved in.\nI can’t believe how well this works. I’m still in shock!\n2 days ago, I started to become sick with the flu when I was on a 18-hour flight. On came the chills and fever, and then my nose kept running non-stop. To make it worse, the changing cabin pressure on the descent gave me excruciating sinus pain and made my ears clogged to the point where I couldn’t hear out of both ears anymore. I can’t take cold medicine because I have thyroid disease, and I am slow to recover because my metabolism is very slow.\nYesterday my sinuses and fever got worse. I remembered reading about this remedy on Earth Clinic and I was eager to try it. Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand. I used V8 Spicy Hot juice, lemon juice (bottled), minced garlic, a lot of tabasco sauce (as much as I could stand) and a dash of celery salt for taste. I heated it in the microwave for about 1 1/2 minutes and then sipped and inhaled the fumes as directed. About 10 minutes after I started to sip it I noticed an increase of nasal discharge. I had to keep blowing my nose over and over again, but this time when I blew my nose I actually felt like I was clearing it out, instead of the feeling of blowing your nose and feeling like it gets clogged up again 5 minutes later. The pressure in my ears released about 60% and I regained most of my hearing. My fever increased and for a few hours I felt pretty rotten, even though my nasal passages had cleared. But in a few hours I felt at least 60% better, which is amazing considering that it usually takes me 3 weeks to recover from a cold! I slept all through the night with no problem.\nThis morning I made another tomato tea. While drinking it, I felt my left ear “pop” and the pressure released. I now have full hearing in my left ear and a 70% improvement in my right ear. I then took a hot shower afterwards (the steam helps to open the sinus passages) and kept blowing my nose. My nasal congestion is about 85% gone, I don’t have a fever or chills anymore, I got most of my hearing back and I don’t feel groggy anymore!\nIt doesn’t seem so crazy why this works when you do some research on capsaicin. Capsaicin is also the active ingredient of pepper spray. Capsaicin is an irritant, and when you inhale pepper spray, your body pushes it out by forcing your sinuses to clear themselves and making your nose run uncontrollably. Have you ever eaten a really spicy dish and had your nose start to run?That’s the capsaicin at work.\nI have Vietnamese friends who swear by a similar remedy that works in the same way as the tomato tea. They swear by eating pho (a hot fish/noodle soup) when you are sick. They put a lot of Sriracha (Vietnamese hot pepper sauce) in the soup and breathe in the hot fumes. The steam and pepper helps open and clear the sinuses.\nI have also been drinking echinacea tea with a tbs of coconut oil and I’ve also been drinking some ACV throughout the day. (I don’t take the ACV too close to the tomato tea though, because ACV is alkaline while the tomato tea is very acidic).\nEC: Check out the classic Tomato Tea Recipe from Earth Clinic here. A number one remedy for colds and sinus congestion.\nForever debted for this remedy. Sometimes I just opt for a tomato instead, or easier – a tablespoon of tomato ketchup is suffice. I think tomato is the star here. thanks earth clinic.\nRealise I had a long lingering virus in my system. I pressed and munched several cloves of raw garlic and ate this with a little wholemeal bread and butter, hit the aspirin and VIT C and I am pretty sure that has done the trick! I also had the beginnings of a gastro attack and a strong drink of ACV and water stopped that in its tracks last Sunday. Reading ads for NZ Manuka honey I see that they are pushing the fact that it induces the body to produce more H2O2.\"\nAround lunch time I started getting the first signs of a flu… Just in nostril. Post nasal drip, beginning to feel that flu like symptoms coming on. Later in the afternoon some sneezing began.\nI took an cotton ear bud, dipped it in ACV then inserted it into my nostril. Made my sneeze straight away. So blew my nose and tried again, this time holding off sneezing while I did both nostrils, and sniffed in, held it and the gave the biggest sneeze.\nI repeated the process immediately. its a little un comfortable/irritating. but I felt better almost immediately. Later that night I repeated again twice. Swabbed the inside of each nostril deep with ACV soaked cotton tip. Sniffed in hard, held as long as I could, then sneezed a few times.\nThe amazing thing is the next morning I work up feeling fine.\nI am so very very thankful for you, I have influenza I was in the ER Sunday night- could not breathe they did take a chest xray and said my lungs looked good other then the blotch on the right lung from the influenza. They tested my blood to make sure of no clots and they gave me oxygen while there and vicodin to take home. However they could not give me anything else because it had already been 5 days. I was taking an antibiotic I had in my cupboard it is for upper respitory and also phemonia, big mistake as it did not help. As I know something that is viral can’t be helped by antibiotics. I have been taking at least 8 vitamin D3’s well I started that yesterday, boiled some water with ACV in it yesterday and inhaled it into my lungs, and then I also drank some ACV in tepid water. I also been doing Mega vitamin C (well it is called ermergenC) 1000 mg in one glass.\nI've used apple cider vinegar for a cold successfully but for a flu, it did very little if anything. No change really whatsoever. I've had one of the worst strain of flu for about 4 days now and I have taken more ACV than you could shake a stick at and nothing. I've also been taking colloidal silver, black strap molasses, liquid chlorophil and tea with ginger, honey and lemon. The tea has worked the best in stopping the cough.\nI became ill with upper respiratory symptoms on Wednesday, and by Friday morning I was unable to go to work. On Saturday, I was so congested I could not breathe out of my nose. The over the counter medication had stopped working and by nightfall, I knew I was in trouble and would not be able to sleep. Suffering from an unbearable headache, overall aches and pains with fever, in desperation I searched the internet hoping to find a natural cure, which would provide me with some relief until I could call my doctor on Monday morning. I came across your website and sent my husband to the store to buy the ACV. I took 2 Tablespoons in 8 oz of warm water for my first dose at midnight and woke up at 4am and realized I could breathe, – my nose had cleared! I took another dose before going to sleep, and another around noon. I felt reasonably well to cook dinner on Monday night and went back to work on Tuesday. This remedy is nothing short of a miracle for me and I cannot wait to share it friends and family. Now that I feel better, I am anxious to investigate the rest of your site. ACV will definitely be a regular part of my diet, as I am a chronic sinus sufferer. Antibiotics offer some relief, but do not cure the problem. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for posting this natural remedy. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\nAt the first sign of flu or cold, I drank 2 tablespoons of organic ACV with about 8oz of warm water, squeeze of lemon & honey for taste, every morning for about 3 days. Almost everyone in the household is sick, however, the ones that tried this concoction never did get sick. Thank you to earth clinic for this wonderful recipe!!\np.s. Because of it’s many benefits, I have been drinking a cup of ACV “tea” (w/ 2 teaspoons rather than tablespoons) every morning instead of my usual cup of joe. I like to do this before brushing my teeth so I can properly rinse off any acid left over from the ACV – just in case!\nI stumbled upon this site looking for a cure for the flu. I am amazed and had never heard of the healing powers of Apple Cider Vinegar. I am now a believer and will tell anyone who will listen. My symptoms started out as allergies then went to a sinus infection then started feeling like the flu. This went on for over a month with the flu being the last straw to bring me to the internet to search for an alternative to OTC medicines. Within the first few hours my symptoms had reduced in severity, the first to break was the fever. I have continued the last two weeks various concoctions. One being 2 Tablespoons ACV to 4-6oz orange juice. I would take this as much as 3x a day. I also suffer from back pain where I was popping pain pills and muscle relaxers and ibuprofen on a regular basis. Most of this has gone on for almost 2 years–the last week I have hardly taken any of them. I don't know if it is the ACV but I will continue using daily. I have also read it helps with depression and can't wait to see if it helps with my occasional bouts. I have also tried 2T ACV in 6oz of warm water with honey to sweeten–wasn't too crazy about that. I tried it today with 2T ACV and 8oz room temp water with a straw and this actually wasn't too bad. I think that last concoction is something I could mix and put in the fridge so that I don't have to mix it every glass. I will try this out and others and post again my results.\nACV, Orange Juice, and Honey!!!\nYea, for Apple Cider Vinegar!!! Thank God for this site! I did a frantic search after my husband and I were both attacked by a wicked flu bug that has lasted almost 3 weeks. We're finally over the worst symptoms; but the cough (especially his) was the very last thing to go…and it wasn't going without a fight. For 2 weeks, we had tried \"everything\" including OTC drugs. I also had severe phlegm in the back of my throat, and had lots of nasal mucous. Both were extremely difficult to expel; and his cough was so consistent that it caused him headaches and stomach cramping. I tried the solution of 4 Tablespoons OJ, 2 Tablespoons honey and 2 Tablespoons ACV…within 1 hour we were both relieved of the symptoms and before the day was over, we knew we were on to the cure! We heated our recipe to make it a little easier to digest. It doesnt taste too bad, but its a long way from tasting good, and the strong taste is \"oh, so worth it\"! Thank you all for your suggestions, and thanks for this site. It is a God-send!!!\nMy girlfriend got a flu over the weekend. So I went to earth clinc since they cured my allergies. Again ACV had a lot of results, so I gave her a glass of generic organic ACV. Within 30 minutes her fever was gone and so was her nausea and sniffles. And this was after a day of intense symptoms. The next day I poured some H2O2 in her ears as a precaution. By the third day all she had was a cough. I gave her about 2 glasses a day with 2 tablespoons ACV. I also had one glass a day and never caught anything. Thanks again Earth Clinic.\nI have been waiting until the end of the school year to report on my success with organic ACV with the “mother”. I have been a tutor in an elementary school for three years now. The first two years I caught everything imaginable…constant sore throats, horrendous coughs, runny noses, on and on all year….I truely was constantly fighting something. Last Fall before the start of the year I began to take 1/4 cup of ACV with tomato juice faithfully once a day. AMAZING….I have not so much as had a sniffle the entire year….no flu, no colds, no anything. I’m in my late 50’s and until discovering ACV I believed I needed to quit a position with children that I loved!! This is good news in my world and what have you got to lose by trying it? I tell anyone who will listen about this simple natural “cure-all”….I’m living proof of it’s benefits!!!!\nMy husband had a headache for 2 days, achy body & fever on and off & nausea. I was afraid it was the start of swine flu. We had been exposed to people with it, For the nausea, I gave him some “pink bismuth”. But for the other symptoms, I used 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar mixed with about a cup of apple juice. He then drink some warm green tea. Within minutes, the symptoms went away and he seemed his old self again! He felt so good that he started playing his drums again! He hadn’t played in 2 days!I have used ACV for cough , but never for flu symptoms and I’m so excited it worked!\napple cider vinegar for flu .. I started feeling sick yesterday and i was worried about this swine flu so i bought organic apple cider vinegar, put 2 table spoons in a cup of water and sweetened it with stevia liquid extract. had a couple more doses of it and 3 hours later my flu like symptoms went away .\nmy symptoms were; a mild fever, cold sweating and diarrhea, i don’t know if i actually had swine flu but here i am feeling fine.\nThanks to God for showing this wonderful site. I was suffering with Sore Thoart and body pains, Sinus congestion. So, I went on to the internet to try some home remedies becoz i am tried of taking antiboitics. Then I saw many people taking about good things of ACV then I wanted to try. I took ACV in the afternoon after couple of hours I started feeling better. I am taking it daily and it’s improving better. Thanks you everyone.\nThanks for the website. I have used apple cider vinegar since the 70's but somehow (maybe good health) it went off my radar. I just caught a nasty flu and going into day #3 was not cheering me up. I looked on your site and my lights went back on. I did my 3 Tablespoons. acv + 3Tablespoons.honey and 1/2 t. cinnamon in 6 oz. water and within 2 hours felt like I just might shake this today. 4 hours later (now) I am feeling really much better and even the cough is almost gone.\nSince I can remember, I have had one or two bouts a year with sore throat and cold/flu that turns into bronchitis. An elderly gentleman who remembered taking acv mixed with honey as recommended by his doctor when he was a child told me try it for my ailments. It has worked like nothing before! Mixed 50/50 with honey in a shot glass(for sore throat), as a straight shot(this burns the tummy a little), or 2 tablespoons with a cup of warm water for respiratory/sinus problems. I have not been sick since I started taking ACV at the first sign of illness. My children have used it as well. They aren’t real happy with the taste and smell but I am happy with the results! Hard for doctors to get rich recommending this home remedy!\nMy husband of 81 yrs recently was very sick with a bad cold (or flu?) and had a sore throat, and I (61 yrs old) felt I was also just catching it (just beginning to notice a scratchy throat, and have some congestion). We don’t have any “extra” money, and I hate the idea of giving it all to the big pharmaceutical companies for the “privilege” of taking potentially toxic concoctions, so I’m always looking for cheap and natural ways to do things, and I looked online for cold remedies, and found EarthClinic. That first evening I read about Apple Cider Vinegar for flu/colds/congestion, and both my husband and I immediately started using it (1 Tablespoon in a glass of water, 3 times per day). It didn’t taste wonderful, but wasn’t TOO bad, and, after all, we were using it as “medicine”…and it did cure both my husband’s and my sore throats (Mine within minutes, my husbands within 3 doses). The next day, while continuing the ACV 3/day, I also tried Jean’s Tomato Tea because we were both still so congested. My husband usually likes slightly spice-hot foods, and I usually don’t, but with the Tomato Tea he didn’t like the “hot” sensation of the spiciness, and refused to drink any more after that first try—while I was instantly aware of it clearing my sinuses and soothing my throat, so I continued to use it over the next 3 days. It worked well for me as a decongestant, but my cold was still very much “there”, and I began gaining weight (controlling my weight has been a life-long problem for me), so I stopped using the Tomato Tea, but continued the ACV 3/day. It has now been about a week, and my husband is completely healthy, and this morning I am feeling much better and much less congested.\nOn the second morning after my husband and I began using ACV, we both lost weight. He has continued with a loss each day, and has now lost 7 pounds in 7 days. I had lost 3 pounds, then gained part of it back while I was using Tomato Tea, but now I am slowly losing again, so long as I don’t eat anything with sugar and/or processed wheat flour.\nMy son had an awful flu that laid him off work for a week. I started to get the same symptons that he started with. I have used the H2O2 in my ears before and fortunately was able to stop it with that and bed rest for a day and also staying away from sugary foods. However, I am doing a pretty stressful job at the moment and finishing a Project at my volunteer organisation. This morning I woke up with my ears very sore and a sore throat. I used the H2O2 in my ears again a couple of times until the fizzing stopped which eased the soreness alot except for one spot in my right ear. I came to work and grabbed some immune boosters from the Health Shop but my throat was still sore. I found your site when I was looking up the info about H2O2 and colds and flu as I hadn’t read it for a couple of years and I had been telling the owner of the Health Shop about it. I saw ACV mentioned in the testimonials about using H2O2 orally so had a look at the ACV testimonials as well.\nI’ve just come Back from the supermarket with ACV and measured a couple of tablespoons [by eye] with a teaspoon of honey into a mug of warm water. The relief to my throat was almost instant and I’m really enjoying sipping on it. I’m even starting to pick up a bit of energy too. Thanks for reminding me about something so effective that I had used in the past and had forgot.\nTwo days ago, I came down with a nasty flu, and had a fever of 102. Luckily, that’s gone down considerably, but a lot of symptoms remain. I googled flu cures, and this site popped up. I actually found a bunch of remedies here that seemed plausible, but the sheer amount of positive feedback for apple cider vinegar really caught my eye. I had some already, and decided to try it out. This morning, I heated about 10 oz. of water, then added 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar and a splash of lemon juice. I hated the taste, so for lunch I tried something different (new, not found here).\nI heated about 8 oz of orange juice, then 2 tsp of acv. As an addition, and because I’d read about its benefits here, aw well, I added a couple of shakes of ground cinnamon (probably 1/2 tsp or so). I can’t taste the vinegar, and I feel better already! Aches are easing, my stomach and intestines are settled, and I don’t feel nearly as “bleh” as just half an hour ago. I’ll keep it up for a couple of days, here’s hoping it continues working! I’m thinking of trying oil pulling next if this keeps up, I’m definitely a believer now.\nI have been drinking ACV in hot vegetable broth for a couple of years now, every time I feel virus-y or like I’m coming down with a virus. I usually feel it in my stomach first, and I get exhausted and lethargic, and sleepy. Food is the last thing on my mind! But for some reason, when I feel bad like this, I’ll crave ACV in something hot and salty like broth. I usually heat up some water and add the vegetable cubes or broth mix, about 1-3 tbsp of ACV, a tbsp of lemon, and about 1-2 tbsp of fresh ginger (I get it pre-minced in a glass jar). I don’t know what it is, but within a few minutes of drinking this, I always feel so much better. It’s like my body is craving this concoction, and it’s the only thing that will make it feel better. Of course, you should adjust the measurements of ACV, ginger, etc to what you think your body will need…I usually try it out while its heating to check it for potency. I would love to know if this has worked for anyone else!\ni’ve been decked by a really nasty flu for the last 3 days. After taking all the usual over the counter remedies for it to no avail, i decided to look on the net to see if there was any natural cure. Ran across this page on ACV, decided what the hell and tried it out. That was maybe about an hour ago and, no joke, i swear i’m starting to feel better already. I took two straight tablespoons and if my symptoms don’t clear up i’ll take another 2 tomorrow. Thanks for putting this up.\nI have been taking 1Tablespoon organic applecider vinegar and 1 Tablespoon pure honey in 6-8 ounces room temp. water every day 4 5yrs and have not had a cold or flu. When I first heard about it from one of my old friends I was skeptical. But I have to tell you it is awful nice not to be down sick.I’m around a lot of sick people and I’m the only one OK.They ask me I just tell them but most people won’t It’s the ones like us that want to stay well that risk these old remedies.\nFirst of all, I thank GOD for helping me find your site to try these wonderful remedies! I started out with a sore throat and gargled water mixed with cayenne powder; it helped short term. But then I had a nasty cough (associated with the sore throat), so I drank 2 TBSP of apple cider vinegar throughout the day. It seemed to make my coughs more productive. When I woke up the next day, I hacked up a lot of mucous, and felt like I was getting better. Then I made a pot of tomato tea and I am well again 🙂 Thank you very much! Your site is a priceless wealth of information.\nI was really skeptical about this, but with a deployed husband and two kids (and after enduring a seven hour 103 degree fever that wouldn’t break with tylenol or motrin or excedrine sinus headache) i figured it was worth a try. I am so glad I tried it, within an hour my fever broke and already i can breathe through my nose. i will never suffer again like that! This is becoming a routine for me I can’t afford to be sick. Thank you so much for giving me a solution that still lets me be alert enough for twin 15 month olds!\nBest Thing Since Sliced Bread: Ok, I know, everybody starts reading and thinking. Yeah right, none of these stories are true. Well, rest assured, they are very real. Now, I’ve been sick for going on 2 freakin weeks here. Have gotten zero sleep do to the headaches and sinus pressure. So, not being able to sleep here, I started surfing the net, and ended up here on your site, because I have been taking antibiotics and whatever else I could get my hands on to try to get the headache to stop and to try to get some form of relief. Well, I kept reading through all the postings and then I decided to give this a shot, nothing else worked, do why not! I poured about 1/4 cup [ACV] in a glass, then added about 7 or 8 ounces of water. Began drinking it… Keep in mind, I can’t smell or taste a thing here, so wasn’t that hard to do actually. I did this at 0615 and its about 45 minutes later now, and I am starting to feel the nasal airway open slowly, my ears, well, they sound like popcorn going off, and the headache is getting a little better. Now don’t go trying to give your loved one a kiss after drinking this tonic, they will have to no part of it or you for a little bit there. Give this a try,you just might be as surprized!\nCayenne is a cureall. I thought I was the only one who knew the connection between dairy and sinusitis and the flu, every time I drink milk or eat ice cream, I get sick with sinus problems and then came down with the flu. Cayenne with distilled water, lemon juice and acv, was the only cure which helped me flush out the fever. This may sound crazy, but dairy products make me moody and emotional, like I can feel how “SAD” the cows are, I try to only do organic dairy now.\nFor eleven years I have been a high school teacher. I have never missed a day because of illness. I have started to get a cold and felt ill, but nothing serious in all those years. And I deal daily with students who say they are sick and should be home. They sneeze and cough around me all day and I don’t catch a bug. Every morning, weekends included, I drink a tea of half cup of very hot water with a large spoonful of honey stirred in, a glub, glub of vinegar poured in, and shot of some kind of juice (grape, apple, berry) to enhance the flavor.\nHi, I have had a recurring Urinary Tract infection so far 3 times in the past 6 months, to which my Dr has prescribed antibiotics. I felt it coming on and as my Dr was out of town was unable to get my prescription refilled for antibiotics. As I was in a great deal of pain (for 3 days and popping AZO tabs like mints) I was searching the internet for a natural remedy and came across this website. I did the vinegar and baking soda remedy and within a few hours the pain was completely gone and has not returned. I didn’t have ACV on hand so I did it with just plain white vinegar (2T), baking soda (1t) and water and added a few drops of cayenne pepper. I am so happy!!! Yesterday I was coming home from a trip a feeling myself coming down with Flu Sx (achy, sore throat, and weak). I took some Advil to get thru the long car trip home. When I got home I was exhausted and went right to bed. When I woke up I felt horrible as I could barely swallow, my ears, and face (sinuses) hurt, as well as achy joints all over. I was eager to try the ACV and baking soda (added cayenne and echinacea drops too) cure and took the first drink at about 3 am. It is now 2pm the next day I have taken about 5 glassfuls and I feel 100% better. I still have very mild tired feeling but all other sx are completely gone. Its amazing!\nI'recently had a severe flu. My muscles tight, energy low. I made a bath of 16 oz., apple cider vinegar, 1/2 bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide, 2 cups epsom salts, and 10 drops eucalyptus oil. before the bath I could barely move, no energy, poor breathing. Within an hour after the bath, I was already healing. Took another one the next day, and could tell that what could have been a week of illness, was already on its way to recovery. i take acv daily also: 2 Tablespoons, 1/2 lime, and 1 Tablespoon of raw honey. – I was told this brings the body's ph to 7. (perfect balance) I have given this formula to many people and have had much feed back about more energy, better digestion, etc. A good way to begin the day, setting the body's stasis point well, which lessens cravings for sugar.\nI started taking ACV on a regular basis after reading about its health benefits on this web-site. I found it very helpful in relieving my nausea caused by, what I believed, a stomach flu (which my daughter and husband already had gone thru several days ago). When I felt the symptoms myself, I googled some cures and that’s how I came across the information about ACV. I’ve been taking – for three weeks now- on and off- 1tsp ACV diluted in 1/4 cup of water, three times daily. I noticed though that if I don’t take it I start feeling nauseated. The nausea doesn’t go away until I sip another dose. Yesterday I took a Zantac pill which helped me in 20-30 minutes. My questions are: Does taking ACV on a regular basis cause any adverse effects? Is it possible to get accustomed to taking it and have difficulty stopping later?\nMy nutritionist gave me the following advice: I’m steaming for my lungs and sinuses, 5 min. every 12 hours, …steam is perfect just before the boil, taking it in alternative ways, every which way possible, in mouth out mouth, mouth/nose, one nostril/mouth, one nostril/other nostril, one nostril/same nostril, etc. to chase out the germs wherever they may hide, germs that cycle in 12 hour increments. Rules are twice only per day. No more than 5 min. NO burning of nostrils (causes bugs to burrow deeper), so care must be there not to make the steam too hot or too much.\nAnd baths with apple cider vinegar (you can use the cheap kind for baths), a cup per bath, are supposed to make viruses take a hike. I’ve seen it happen, esp. with young kids who spring out of the bath ready for action afterwards, if it was a virus, that is. I’m just soaking my feet tonight, too lazy for the bath. But the bath is supposed to create a ph that makes a virus split. Let me know if anyone finds this works, as I’ve seen several cases.\nI have been sick for three days and just tried the Apple Cider Vinegar & Lemon Drink and within 5 mins my nose and congestion has started to break up. Thanks for the tip.\nYou can add 1/4 tsp cayenne, and 1/4 tsp fresh ginger also if the first three ingredients don’t work right away.\nMix in a little warmed water to liquefy, drink, and then rinse the teeth thoroughly. After the initial rush, you can drink warm tea, or water to settle the stomach. Most have an immediate reaction where they get their voice back and clear out the mucus in their nose and throat. Try it, all the kids do, and now even their moms drink it and swear by it! One mom even works at the medical clinic and uses my cure instead of the doctor’s one.\nTried this a few times. Didn't noticeably help. Sorry.\nCarol's cure all drink was the best remedy I tried so far. I tried the tomato tea and it probably does boost the immune system, but this remedy did stop the thick phlegm that was blocking my airway and causing me to cough like crazy, and it worked almost immediately. I drank this twice yesterday and plan to have it twice today.\nWhen I was a young kid one day my sister came home and said that she had the best snack at a friend’s house on the way home from school. She said that she would find out exactly what it was and that she would make us some one day. Her friend’s grandmother had taken garden fresh cold thinly sliced cucumber slices and thin slices of sweet vadalia onion, sprinkling a fair amount of salt and pepper and then covering them with White House Apple Cider Vinegar(5% Acidity) letting them soak for ten or fifteen minutes. The girls used little wooden skewers to stab the sour & tangy vegetable concoction and used a small round soup spoon to sip the sour vinegar juice – they also had it served with an ice cold 6 oz bottle of Coca-Cola over ice (Talking about the acids, lol!!!). I had always has a taste for sour things like pickles, mustard, sauerkraut, and plenty of ACV on my turnip greens. After having this concoction once I soon developed a craving for it. It seemed whenever I was sick and had a fever, sore throat, ear infection or just about anything I would always crave the sour taste of these cucumbers, onions, salt, pepper, and plenty of fresh apple cider vinegar and would start out nibbling on them slowly until after ten or fifteen minutes began feeling better. No sooner that I would finish them it was no time until I was feeling so much better. Even before I heard that ACV was really good for you in my mind and my heart I knew that there was something really special about apple cider vinegar because every time I consumed it I seemed to get over what was ailing me in no time and was heeled and it sure did make a believer out of me. It just works and I began to swear by it to all of my family members and to anyone else that I could testify too because I wanted them to get the same fast relief from ACV that I had received.. My sister that had turned me on to this supposed snack that turned out to be a healing remedy already liked this concoction and it didn’t take much to convince her that it ! was a po werful aide in healing just about anything that ailed you. My sister and I still have the cravings for this vinegar concoction and my niece has also taken up liking the concoction also. I know that it’s not for everyone because there are some out there (like my fiance) that can’t stand the thought of eating or drinking anything with ACV on or in it. Good luck to all of you that are willing to try this powerful anti-oxidant, it will change your life.\nNormal vinegar can be a useful cure to the common flu. Although it’s not a miracle cure and takes about 2 days to clear up the flu, it’s very effective since most people with flu are ill for just under a week while taking medication. When I was a child and an adult I soak a cloth with vinegar and wrap it around my feet. Hoping to extract the heat from my feet hence lowering the temperature and curing flu.\nI have had heartburn, indigestion, flatulence & etc., all in all, I have bad stomach. However, I got to know about apple cider vinegar few years ago through my pharmacist friend. Since then, my stomach condition never felt better! Then, I began to be my own doctor. Whenever I have sore throat or infection (tonsillitis), I gulp down ACV. Well, I strongly think that the vitamin C in ACV helps me a lot during fever or flu. I always recommend to my friends although most of them fail to appreciate or admire the goodness of ACV because of the taste & aroma. Can’t blame them!\nI have been real sick with a viral infection and flu my neighbor fixed me some Apple Cider Vinegar and Honey. Equal parts of each. It has worked wonders. It cuts the phlegm in your throat and helps with all that was ailing me. I am so glad to find out about this. I also heard that cinnamon with it works wonders as well. Just a teaspoon or so. Thank you and God Bless."

I could eat chilli by the gallon.\nI’m not vegetarian, but I find eating veggie meals regularly is a great way to cut down on fat, get your five a day and be a little kinder to the environment, not to mention saving a few quid.\nSo I knocked up this vegetarian chilli and it’s now a staple part of my cooking regime, I honestly love it. It’s got all the same flavours of my old beef chilli recipes and just as much punch, and piled on top of a delicious baked potato makes for a mouth-watering meal.\nSeasoning is essential to this dish, so make sure your store cupboard is stocked up! Dried garlic flakes (or fresh if you’ve got it) go into the pan to cook with the onion and carrot, and while paprika, cumin, cinnamon and chilli flakes are a great flavour combo for chilli. And, of course, salt and pepper for good measure!\n2. Into a hot frying pan, add the onion, carrot and garlic and fry for a couple of minutes.\n3. Then add, well, pretty much everything else! The tin of chopped tomatoes, veggie mince, pepper, tomato puree and all the spices – paprika, cumin, cinnamon, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. This is a vegetarian recipe, of course, but if you really feel like you need some kind of meat in there, you can add a crumbled beef stock cube into the pan at this point too. But, I promise, it really doesn’t need it! A vegetable stock cube will do the job.\n4. Simmer for 15 – 20 minutes with the kidney beans going in for the last couple of minutes.\n5. Pop the potato out of the oven or microwave, open it up and pile on the chilli!\nWhen you think of chilli, it’s all about big, bold spices – that’s no different when it comes to this veggie version! Make sure you’re generous with your seasoning because you really want that flavour to shine.\nTry swapping out the potato for a scrumptious baked sweet potato instead. Y-U-M!\nAlways go overboard on how much you cook here, because these leftovers make an excellent lunch the next day!"

You can create several snowmen from bottle caps by attaching eyes and a piece of ribbon, then creating a hat and a nose and drawing buttons and a smile.\nCover the table with newspapers. Provide yourself or your children with paint and brushes. Explain to them that they will be painting two bottle caps and allowing it to dry while they create the hat and nose.\nCut out a small rectangle (1/2 inch). Then cut the rectangle in half to make the nose of the snowman.\nMake a small red and white Santa hat using red and white construction paper or felt. You can fold the top of the hat over so that it looks like the top of the hat is drooping down.\nWhen the paint is dried, glue both bottle caps together. You should glue the edges that will touch (the top and the bottom caps).

        "text": "Endlessly open to admiration and interpretation.\nSome laws need explanation. Others are understandable based on their nature. They affect our shared feelings of right and wrong. That you cannot kill your noisy neighbor is morally self-explanatory. Yet the less straightforward laws can often be most interesting ones, particularly if they undergo constitutional court review.\nThe Biblical Ten Commandments, standards to live by, were delivered from Mount Sinai by Moses. Many religions have since adopted them in one form or another. Sermons and teachings served to explain and interpret them over the centuries, understandably since each generation wants to understand the laws and beliefs that individuals and communities are asked to live by, and to sense they are true to human nature.\nDemocratic laws are not commandments. They are debated in legislatures before being passed and taking effect. In a perfect world we'd like to believe that all sides are heard for all proposed legislation, the final vote the culmination of a rational process in which each legislator has acted freely, without political pressure, according to conscience. But the world isn't perfect and laws can be passed for political reasons that can violate either our sense of right and wrong or even our national constitutions.\nFor spiritual matters, we each have our conscience as guide: the court of the soul can be unforgiving. But for errant legislation, we must often turn to the national constitutional court to arbitrate whether a law is acceptable.\n\"Jane Roe\" McCorvey: Second thoughts.\nIn the United States and Italy, the constitutional court exists to review matters of law in light of the wording of their country's respective constitutions. Here is where the similarities end. The constitutions of the two countries came into being during different periods of history. The U.S. Constitution was adopted in 1787, after the Revolutionary War, while Italy's was drafted in 1948 following World War II.\nLogically, each constitution was written to reflect the times and cultures. As a result, the U.S. constitution concentrates much of its power on the protection of individual rights, while Italy's focuses on social justice. Combine these divergent perspectives with a parallel debate — whether the wording of a constitution should be applied literally or be interpreted in light of current affairs — and you get a wonderful mix of profound historical and cultural forces on which inspired judges can bring their intellectual and spiritual power to bear, having an impact on how we lead our daily lives.\nI remember a non-constitutional case in Colorado where a man shot and killed his neighbor's dog because he said it was bothering his horse. Colorado law at the time permitted the killing of animals that were \"worrying\" livestock. The dog's owner acted as his own lawyer and, though he had never tried a case before and presented his evidence haphazardly, the judge found in his favor. Why? The killer of his dog was not being \"neighborly\" and acted outside the \"spirit\" of the law. Judicial interpretation all the way. His implicit message: \"Talk before you shoot.\" Whether the decision was correct depends on your legal vantage point.\nThe constitutional stage is grander with far greater consequences. Constitutional courts confront difficult cases often in the midst of a roiling sea of public opinion. Consider abortion.\nThe U.S. and Italy initially approached abortion similarly. Since abortion's legality is not addressed in either country's constitution it was left to legislatures — in the U.S. those of the individual states, in Italy the national parliament — to rule on legality. Though Italy is home to the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican, which vehemently opposes the practice, a woman's right to an abortion in the first 90 days of pregnancy was guaranteed a secular, legal framework beginning in 1978. Abortion clinics are publicly funded and supervised.\nU.S. abortion laws are state-managed. Restrictions vary, usually based on circumstances and the length of a pregnancy. In 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court waded into deep water by taking on the Texas appeal case of Roe v. Wade. Jane Roe was an alias for Norma Leah McCorvey, an unmarried woman seeking an abortion, while Wade was Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade, who argued for Texas' longstanding anti-abortion law.\nThe Court struck down the Texas law as overly restrictive, thus bringing abortion under the \"right to privacy\" penumbra that the Court had intrinsically tied to the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. The clause bars state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without applying Bill of Rights-style fairness. Privacy, said the Court, was a fundamental aspect of personal liberty.\nThe 7-2 decision touched off a firestorm regarding how the U.S. Constitution should be read and applied. The justices who opposed the verdict, Byron White and William Rehnquist, were livid, calling the majority decision an \"improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review\" in their vivid dissent. In the late 1990s, \"Jane Roe\" McCorvey joined the Catholic Church and became a pro-life activist.\nFour decades later, the ruling remains among the most controversial in U.S. history. But few actually take the time to read it. It's a remarkable ruling whose wording addresses constitutional history in the context of modern science and societal concerns, seeking a solution that attempts to balance them all (\"Population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial overtones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem,\" the Court wrote). Whatever your view of the outcome, judicial thinking and a methodology are on full display.\nIf you've never read a constitutional opinion then here's a deeply worthwhile place to start. It also serves as a leg up on my next column, which probes Italy's judicial workings."

        "text": "As wonderful as reading is, there are pitfalls to being a fanatic.\nNever fear. I’m not just going to point out why obsessively reading can sometimes be a bad thing, I’ll share some tips to address these pitfalls and turn them into merely adorable quirks. Let’s just consider this post a bookworm intervention to prevent or treat the unfavorable results of constantly reading.\nWhen you own so many books, they take over every nook and cranny. Although Dr. Seuss would be delighted about it, it can easily and quickly appear cluttered, to put it mildly. While some of us like rooms filled and “cluttered” with books, it can be uncomfortable and messy-looking to others. To prevent being nominated to be on the show Hoarding: Buried Alive, we need to make sure our books are organized.\nSolution: There are thousands of book organization options from clever and adorable storage containers, to arranging books by color, to organizing your books by size to save space. If you can stay on top of the mounting piles of books, your house doesn’t have to be that house.\nSometimes we bookworms prefer the company of paper, ink, and our imaginations over the company of people. And that’s the way some like it most of the time. But when you love fictional characters more than real people, it can be difficult to make friends or meet people who share your particular reading interests.\nSolution: find others who share your affinity for reading by joining or creating book clubs, make friends with your local librarians (who love books too and are usually really, really nice), or put down the book just for a little bit and talk to people about other interests you have. You do have other interests, right? Well, if you don’t, you can try developing some.\nWhen you spend your free time reading, you don’t watch shows that “everyone talks about.” From my own experience, I end up just sitting there with a blank expression on my face and feeling dumb. And confused. How do people have enough time to watch all those different shows?\nSolution: You have to be picky about the shows and movies you decide to share with your precious reading time. As much as we’d love to be able to be completely caught up on all popular shows, last night’s sports matches, and local and global news and read our beloved books, it isn’t physically possible. Because there are only 24 hours in a day, and that isn’t going to change, you can pick your favorites and then just do research on the ones you feel you need to at least be aware of or informed about to function with your friends and co-workers. Yes, I’m suggesting you fake it or bluff as best as you can. Or if you just don’t care, admit that you aren’t interested in that stuff and find something else to talk about with them. I’ve done both, and I think they both have their place and time.\nYou can’t call yourself a book lover if you haven’t ever stayed up until at least 2 in the morning still wide eyed and anxiously flipping pages. The problem is that we have all the other stuff we need to do the next day: drive, work, take care of kids, live.\nSolution: sneak in sleep (and more reading) whenever you can. Take a cat nap; just don’t forget to set an alarm. As much as we don’t want to do it, we also need to bite the bullet, turn off the light or device, and turn in for the night. The book will still be there the next day. Go to sleep. Believe me, I know this is easier said than done.\nDifficulties can arise when those around you, even if you love those people, don’t share your interests. When you make a funny or clever allusion to a book, they don’t get it. You need to learn to “play nice” and deal with people who don’t appreciate your exact reading tastes.\nSolution: try to compartmentalize yourself and your likes. Some of my siblings and my parents like to read, but generally we don’t share similar likes in what we read. So we focus on other things that we like to do together. We have created a pool of mutual allusions to draw from. My siblings and I can have full conversations in quotes from films we have seen together and make perfect sense. No, I can’t use some of my witty literary quips with my family, but I don’t hold it against them. They are still my kind of weird in other ways.\nWell, let’s talk about one that is a lot tougher to handle. How do you interact with people who don’t like to read much at all? Some comments and conversations can make you feel like you’ve been punched in the gut.\nSolution: I’m lucky enough that I haven’t really encountered this in my family, but I do know some people who fit this description in the “friend” category. If they really don’t like to read and make comments about the books you love, I only have one piece of advice–breathe. Just breathe. Breathe in the calming scent of book pages to soothe yourself, so you don’t lash out.\nThat dreaded moment when you see that a book you love is going to be made into a movie. You’re filled with skepticism and apprehension. Are they going to follow the book or at least stay true to the spirit of the book, or will they change everything? The movie version can be an anxiety-inducing experience for a devoted fan of the book.\nSolution: sometimes skepticism is deserved. But other times, the movie does the book justice and even enhances our reading of the text. When I see a movie adaptation of a book, I usually go in with two sets of expectations–both low to prevent disappointment. If the movie sticks to the book, I expect that the screenwriters had to omit some details, change lines, and change scenes. If the movie deviates from the book, I only ask myself whether the movie was entertaining, thought provoking, etc. in its own right. Prepping myself in this way usually works. I can be pleasantly surprised or disappointed based on reasonable, objective expectations, not based on an emotional connection to the book.\nWhat is your favorite book? I hate that question so much, but any time I say that I love to read, people ask me. I hem and haw.\nSolution: I usually list the genres I like to read and then some examples in each genre. By the time I’ve finished listing books 10 minutes later, the person who asked me usually wishes they hadn’t.\nBuying books isn’t cheap, just like everything else these days. When you collect or hoard books on a regular basis, you probably have to make room in the monthly budget for new books. When we have to choose between hot water and books, it’s a coin toss.\nSolution: there are a surprising number of ways to save money to get books. You can get great discounts on ebooks for cheap and public domain ebooks for free. You can also learn how to budget better using these books.\nIf all else fails, go to the library. Free books! Free, people!\nYou desperately want to know the ending, but you don’t ever want the book to end. You love going to a bookstore but you feel the pain of the cost you pay when you leave. You both love and hate sad endings because they make you think, but you want the characters to be happy.\nSolution: unfortunately, not much can be done to get rid of these conflicting emotions, so embrace them. They are what make us human and empathetic toward others. Enjoy the paradox, my friends.\nBookworm or not, we all need to escape the realities of life somehow every now and then, and out of the options, reading is by far the best one. After all, how else can we live a thousand lives without living vicariously through book characters? We learn so much about life and ourselves from reading. However, immersing so far into fiction can lead us to want the stories in the books we read and dislike our own lives. We get swept away with other people’s lives and stories. Usually it’s a good thing, but it can actually become addicting. I know I’ve gone through times when I wished for nothing more than to enter the story of a book permanently and never return to reality. It can be a slippery slope.\nSolution: we are going to keep reading, just as we should, but instead of enjoying life through the stories of others alone, let’s try to make our own lives a little more interesting, a little more meaningful, so that returning to reality won’t be so hard. Again, I know this is harder done than said. I’m still working on this myself!\nHow have you solved your book lover problems?"

Fun with DePonte.\nHere we are on day five, and I ain’t even slowin’ down yet! However, I did need to give my wallet a rest and draw back on a wine I drank a few weeks back and LOVED- the DePonte Cellars Melon de Bourgogne, 2013 Dundee Hills!\nJust when you think you’ve heard of all the wacky whites in Oregon, here comes another one! Actually, we’ve barely grazed the surface in the white department. More to come. This wine is actually fairly well-known here, and is considered to be DePonte Cellars “flagship” white, amongst a beautiful lineup of Dundee Hills Pinot Noirs. These wines are not distributed in South Carolina, so I was unaware of their existence until I moved here. Score!\nWe’ve now noted that both Alsatian and Spanish varietals can flourish here, and so little Melon brings us to France, specifically to the Loire Valley. In the Loire, Melon de Bourgogne is known as Muscadet. Let it be known that a dry Muscadet is perhaps one of my faaaavorite things in the world. Its a genius little wine; there are insane values to be found, they’re perfect for hot weather and with shellfish.\nHowever, the Nantes region of the Loire Valley where Muscadet comes from is a stone’s throw from the Ocean, so it behaves a bit differently there. Noticeably minerally, briney (mmmm) and with a bracing “fresh ocean breeze” sort of quality. The Willamette Valley is fairly close to the ocean but there is that whole mountain range thing that separates them. We still do benefit from ocean breeze and fog, but not in precisely the same way that Muscadet grapes do. Throw that together with a different soil type and you’ve got a completely different wine.\nThe DePonte Melon takes on a very tropical and floral persona; very outgoing and sunshiney. Energetic, with bright and resounding jasmine, white flowers and honeysuckle. Golden delicious apple, pears and pineapple are also abundant, and it finishes with really nice acidity. Just about 1000 cases were made of the 2013 vintage.\nFood-wise, this wine differs from its French cousin strikingly. Whereas Muscadet and oysters are a dream, this wine could handle an oyster- but perhaps one with a hint of something fruity/citrusy, maybe with the addition of a mignonette. And a more sweet/succulent oyster, not the ultra-briney ones. The DePonte website suggests scallops- I would say absolutely to this idea, but again, a sweet/fresh preparation rather than savory. Savory would be a no-no in my taste bud premonitions. The tropical and floral-ness of this wine would clash with savory. But, I’d be hard pressed to find a better Summertime sipper than this. Fo sho. Writing this has really made me long for warm weather. Le sigh….\nA handful of other producers in Oregon make/plant Melon, but I’ve yet to come across one. The Eyrie made one in 2010, it looks like. Panther Creek did at one time, but I don’t see it on their site as of now.\nThat wraps up day 5! This wine was purchased at the “Deck the Hills” Dundee Hills Tasting Event held at Argyle Winery for $24. I think.\n← Thirty Oregon Wines in Thirty Days: Day 4- we goin’ South!\nPingback: Thirty Oregon Wines in Thirty Days, Day 13! | the wine snob."

From the employer perspective, getting the termination letter right will go a long way toward protecting rights and ratcheting down emotions.\n1. Notice that the action was a termination or discharge.\n2. The date of the termination.\n3. The reasons for the termination. The description should give the employer a realistic chance of proving the basis for termination, and provide the employee adequate notice of the reasons for termination (e.g., “the employee failed to meet production standards”).\nDon’t be too specific (e.g., “the employee failed to meet production quota of 18 widgets per hour three days in a row”), because this may create an insurmountable proof standard for the employer in litigation.\nDon’t be too vague (e.g., “the employee was terminated for poor performance”), because this may unfairly fail to give the employee notice of the reasons for termination, and cast doubt on the employer’s stated reasons for termination.\n4. The dates and subject matter of prior warnings. This information can be an effective deterrent to wrongful termination claims, particularly when documentary evidence supports the prior discipline.\n5. Benefits to which the employee is entitled. These may include the right under COBRA to purchase continued health insurance coverage under the employer’s group plan and information on unemployment benefits.\n6. Circumstances under which the employee had access to a second review or appeal of the termination. It may be of strategic benefit to the employer to agree to characterize the employee’s departure as a layoff, resignation, or retirement. State also whether the employee availed him- or herself of the right of appeal.\n7. The employee’s last day of work. State what company property must be returned by that date.\nThere’s no law that requires an employer to provide a termination letter identifying the reason(s) for the termination. Some employers don’t want to do one because of concerns that they may be used as evidence to support a wrongful termination claim. Others don’t want to use the resources to submit every letter to a human resources representative or employment law counsel for drafting or review.\nBut, from a purely legal perspective, well-written termination letters can be an important deterrent to wrongful termination claims. If they’re done correctly, they can provide persuasive contemporaneous support for the termination and reduce the risk of litigation.\nFor all you need to know about discipline and terminations, turn to CEB’s Advising California Employers and Employees, chap 17. A sample termination letter—along with many other sample employment documents and practical advice—is in CEB’s Drafting Employment Documents for California Employers.\n← Are Miranda Exceptions Now on Your Radar?"

Gold, historically, has been one page. Since I've not seen it yet, I can't say how long it will be. So there could be a chance that both Interlude chapters will be posted together, but don't hold me to it.\nI have done final edits on all the elemental interludes except Gold, which I'm still waiting on. We got through all the edits on chapter 45, the first chapter back in the 'present time' and it's a doozy. You're gonna love the answers it provides.\nAnd some of the answers will be surprising.\nJust because you have all read it is no reason to gloat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nFor those of you who don't know it, editorguy (AJ) has some stories posted at Awesomedude. There's also an interview with him.\nWe seem to have another long hiatus in prospect. We are now entering the second half of the educational year in most of Europe ramping up to the end of year/final exams, and I suspect that doesn't bode well for progress.\nAgain I would say I hope all is well in Icaria.\nI've not heard anything from Jamie in some time. I did send him an email earlier this month when I received some spam. I had advised him it appeared someone had hacked into his email and changing his password should do the trick.\nWell, all we can do is cross our fingers and hope for the best that it is not for a 'bad' reason. If I recall correctly there was a hiatus of over a year first time, presumably when Jamie.wri was doing his final year. Perhaps he is doing a Masters or taking another qualification now.\nAt the moment, there is nothing more to be said, and I promise not to say it.\nI noticed that the Scrolls has now fallen off the current list at AD. Let us hope that is not an ill omen.\nThe university year is now ending in Europe so perhaps some hope still remains.\nI've noticed the same thing, but also noticed that there are several new stories on the list which would explain \"Scrolls\" getting pushed off of the bottom.\nAs much as I would love to see \"Gold\" and \"45\" posted and the story continued, Jamie's well-being (both mental and physical) is more important.\nI figure that if I can wait patiently for a year for a new chapter of \"Kandric\" to be posted, I can wait patiently for anything new for \"Scrolls\" to be posted.\nRL does have that nasty habit of showing it's ugly face from time to time.\nIt was Dude's decision to remove the Scrolls from the story page after six months of inactivity. The story is still available tho by going to the authors section and clicking on Jamies name. When there is finally a new chapter to post, it will reappear on the list.\nI've still not heard from Jamie. I need to try again.\nAfter an issue brought to my attention, I sent it on to Jamie in the hopes of getting an answer. I'm going to post most of it for you. There is something there not for public knowledge just yet.\nYes I did get your first mail and I've been meaning to get in touch with you, but life has really been keeping me busy.\nI'm sure you're aware of the various financial crisis here in Europe. It something that's a serious problem and top priority in the EU and it's certainly impacted me and my work.\nI've been a pretty busy guy for some time.\nI have been working here and there on Scrolls. In fact I'm hoping to take some time this summer to do a few more chapters. I'd really like to get Book 2 finished.\nThe weather here isn't so good. Last summer we really didn't have a summer. Unfortunately I don't thing we'll have a very good one this year also.\nI won't be coming over to the USA this summer, I might make a trip at the end of October into the beginning of November.\nIf I get some things accomplished I'll send them to you. My hotmail was hacked into and I changed the password, but then it happened again so I think I'm giving up on it.\nI really haven't used it for a long time now.\nTake care, have a good summer and I'll try and keep in touch.\nThe reason for the mention of my first email is I know that sometimes Spam can stop it and sometimes people don't think to check the Spam folder.\nWell it is good to know he is alright. Things just aren't going great for him right now. We all have those times. This too shall pass I am sure. I just hope it is sooner than later. As do many I am sure. But most of all, I hope things get better for Jamie quickly.\nThanks for passing it along Jan.\nIt's been awhile since I've done any updating.\nOver the weekend I sent an update to Jamie on something that I'd told him back in June about a policy change in the sick day payout at retirement from my employer that stood to screw me and a lot of others.\nInterlude 7 Gold is on hold for the moment. He's gotten a section of it done. As you know also, Chapter 45 has been written. Jamie has chapter 46 written and is working on chapter 47. Most likely, Book 2, Part 4 will end with Chapter 50. I get the impression that these final chapters will not be released for posting until these last few chapters are done and ready.\nWell, good news in a way. Perhaps he is doing a 'Kyle' and waiting to make it a Christmas or New Year present.\nHe did mention that he hoped to have them done by Christmas but didn't know. I didn't want to raise anyone's hopes by saying that.\nDoing a Kyle? I'm missing something here.\nKyle Aarons The Kandric Saga.\nKyle started a tradition (perhaps accidentally or unintentionally) a few years back whereby he tried to post a new chapter around Christmas or the New Year every year."

The vote on the second reading of the Russian forex regulation bill has been postponed to autumn as ongoing geopolitical tensions are shifting priorities for the Russian Duma. However consultations of the Budget and Financial Markets Committee on the matter of prospective solutions of problems related to regulation of financial markets in Russia have taken place on the 15th of July.\nAccording to information exclusively obtained by Forex Magnates reporters from sources familiar with ongoing discussions there is now additional information about the regulatory framework proposed by the Bank of Russia.\nAccording to the Russian central bank there will be two categories of brokerages which are regulated. The first category entails prime brokers or market makers – those are accepting client money and are executing orders on the foreign exchange markets. The second category is allegedly called a “client” broker (which can be interpreted as a retail broker). Entities regulated under the second category are able to take client deposits, but are obligated by law to channel their order flow only to a regulated Russian prime broker.\nFor now there is no confirmation on the size of capital requirements for prime brokers and retail brokers. According to the information obtained by Forex Magnates no details have been revealed about regulation of introducing brokers which are not taking client deposits at this point in time.\nAnother key point which allegedly has been in the works is the process of client identification. According to current legislation confirmation of identity is only possible if a client presents his documents personally. Amendments to an existing law are in the works so that clients can identify themselves to brokerages by presenting a bank document confirming that the customer has been identified in person by a bank representative.\nThe news comes after a crackdown on offshore regulation in Russia has already been announced and in recent discussions of a draft anti-offshore bill, the Russian parliament has included Cyprus, the Netherlands and Luxembourg into its definition. The new law is aiming to crack down on tax evasion by Russian companies which are registered in tax heavens.\nAre the retail brokers allowed to make markets/run a book, or is this only for STP ?"

Think juicy hues of lemon yellow, orange fizz, kiwi green and blood orange.\nEven a small dose of these bright colours will create an atmosphere bursting with youthful energy to match the little person who’ll be living in the room.\nIf you’re new to decorating with bold colours, why not try before your buy using the Dulux Visualizer app?\nIt gives you an instant impression of how your room will look once it’s been painted and is really easy to use. Simply hold your Smartphone or tablet up to the wall you want to paint, choose any colour from the Dulux paint palette and tap the screen to make the colour appear on your wall.\nIf you think blue and green should never be seen, think again! Grass green and sky blue not only make for a wonderful nature-inspired colour palette, they’re also calming hues that will bring a sense of tranquillity to your baby’s surroundings.\nThe colours contrast beautifully, as blue gives a real sense of space and freedom, while green adds depth and warmth.\nWhy not paint your walls green and your ceiling blue to echo the way the colours appear in nature?\nPink is still a go-to hue for many parents expecting a girl, but if you want to think outside the box, why not try pairing bright pink with turquoise? These colours may seem like a bold combination but when used sparingly they’re surprisingly appealing.\nFor a preppy look, pair an emerald green with a soft, muted pink like blush or dusty rose. Want to make a serious statement? Choose a moss green for the walls and ceiling and paint one wall in a brilliantly hot pink like fuchsia or orchid.\nGive vibrant and uplifting aqua an urban edge by pairing it with a warm muted green. This modern colour combination is perfect for parents who are waiting to find out the gender of their child, or for those who want to create a timeless nursery space.\nCombine with furniture in natural tones, such as brown and white, for an easy-to-live-with look that/s also timeless.\nGive pastels a modern edge by pairing them with a soft shade of brown. When choosing the pastel hues, think candy colours: soft pink, lemon and blueberry. Alone, these shades have the potential to look saccharine, but when paired with a warm neutral, like mocha, chocolate or latte, they take on a modern, sophisticated feel.\nCandy coloured pastels also look fabulous when paired with lots of white and warm wood tones, like oak and timber.\nIf you’re still struggling to choose your paint, why not pick a theme for your nursery and the colours will follow naturally? For example, a woodland theme suggests green paint, while a seaside scheme suggests blue and yellow."

With its characteristic, high front fender, striking flyline and short, high rear, the BMW G 310 GS features classic elements of its big GS sibling models. Its compact proportions with a short wheelbase, a 19-inch front wheel and extended spring travel make for a typical upright posture, promising an agile, nimble riding response.\nLike the G 310 R, the G 310 GS is also designed for the world market. It takes diverse fuel qualities as well as meeting all emissions standards and local requirements. It is at home on all the roads of the world, bringing the hallmark BMW premium aspirations to the segment below 500 cc.\nThe centrepiece of the new BMW G 310 GS is the 313 cc liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine known from the G 310 R with four valves and two overhead camshafts together with electronic fuel injection. The capacity of 313 cc results from a bore of 80 millimetres and a stroke of 62.1 millimetres.\nA salient feature of the single-cylinder engine in the G 310 GS is the fact that its cylinder is tilted to the rear and its cylinder head is rotated by 180 degrees: intake at the front, outlet at the rear. This configuration follows the logic of a straight, power-enhancing supply of fresh air-fuel mixture and also has positive consequences in terms of the bike’s architecture. This results in an output of 25 kW (34 hp) at 9 500 rpm and a maximum torque of 28 Nm at 7 500 rpm.\nThe new G 310 GS provides a relaxed seating position that enables carefree motorcycling pleasure both on the road and during excursions along forest paths and gravel tracks. As is characteristic of BMW Motorrad, all switches and controls are simple and secure to handle. Great importance was attached to simple and safe operation, taking into account the most diverse rider anatomies.\nBridge-type tubular spaceframe, upside-down fork and long swinging arm for a high degree of ride stability, a precise steering response and light handling.\nIn terms of its suspension, the new G 310 GS is similar to the G 310 R roadster in using a tubular steel spaceframe with bolt-on rear section that combines torsional rigidity with robust quality. Given its good stiffness balance, this provides the basis for excellent ride stability and a precise steering response. The front wheel suspension is taken care of by a solid upside-down fork while at the rear there is an aluminium swinging arm in conjunction with a spring strut that is mounted on it directly.\nLike all BMW motorcycles, the new G 310 GS comes with ABS as standard. It combines a high-performance brake system with 2-channel ABS for efficient deceleration and short braking distances. For use over light terrain the ABS in the new G 310 GS can be conveniently deactivated at the press of a button if required. The G 310 GS instrument cluster has a large liquid crystal display that offers excellent clarity and a wide range of information."

On the 3rd June 2015, Prof. Paul Smits, Dean Radboudumc, signed an agreement with Joan Guinovart, Director of IRB. This umbrella agreement paves the way for further strengthening of existing exchanges and exploring new opportunities for collaboration.\nHigh-quality research is a corner-stone of the Radboudumc covering research from molecule to man to population. It is within this academic hospital setting that RIMLS works to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and ultimately to develop tools for “Personalized Healthcare”. In his opening speech, Paul Smits noted the motto of IRB, ‘The medicine of the future starts here’. “I presume ‘here’, could also mean Nijmegen and not just Barcelona!” Present-day science tackles the most complex problems that usually cannot be solved by single researchers or even single institutions. Forming sustainable, interactive networks of scientists across international borders is indispensable for conceptual breakthroughs and translation of fundamental findings into clinical practice.\nConfirmed in a second contract signed by the directors of the programmes, from next year, IRB Masters students will be able to participate in our Molecular mechanisms of Disease (MMD) training. It is a huge boost that a third party institute has such confidence in the quality of our research and education. Furthermore, PhD students will visit be able to visit each other’s centers, and PIs will be invited for seminars. We will also look at the possibility of joint grant applications. Finally, we intend to invite IRB top researchers to apply for the RU Excellence program and/or Radboudumc Hypatia fellowship programme.\nThe visit of the IRB delegation was very positive, setting a concrete basis for further cooperation between our institutions."

Peat forms at the bottom of closed water bodies (usually, bogs) covered with weed and residue of various (including medicinal) plants in the anaerobic conditions. For therapeutic purposes, medicinal mud of peat origin heated to 46–48°C is used. Medicinal mud packs are used to treat various inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Mud application improves peripheral circulation and tissue nutrition, treats chronic inflammatory diseases and has anti-allergic properties; therefore, medicinal peat packs help to treat joint, gynaecological, peripheral nervous system and other diseases.\nGelatinous organic matter with colloidal structure called sapropel takes several thousands of years to form from aquatic fauna and flora at the bottom of lakes. Sapropel is a peloid (mud) of freshwater bodies and bogs. Its composition is the result of a complex mud formation process. Sapropel is formed of decayed plant and animal plankton (small organisms floating in the water), benthos (organisms that live on the bottom of water bodies), and large aquatic plants, i.e. macrophytes (at the end of vegetation). Organic matter from the shores eroded by waves as well as matter carried by surface runoff, rivers, streams and air currents gets mixed in the mud. It takes several thousands of years for sapropel to form, so it is composed of matter free from any technological pollution and is highly valuable as well as organically clean.\nDue to high content of B-group vitamins, micro- and macroelements, essential amino acids and bio-stimulators, sapropel is extremely valuable.\nDuring the treatment, sapropel penetrates not only skin, but deeper tissue and organs as well. Sapropel applications improve circulation and metabolism, helping the body to eliminate the accumulated harmful and toxic substances.\nSapropel applications promote local blood circulation, improving tissue nutrition, speeding up resorption of inflammation areas and reducing activity of the inflammatory process. Medicinal mud relieves pain, vascular spasms, reduces capillary permeability, and normalizes immunobiological and neurovegetative reactivity of the body. Sapropel is used for full-body wraps, hand baths, mineral water and mud baths."

        "text": "Playgroups are important for variety of reasons, but the biggest one out of all the reasons is the role it plays in the development of a child. This prepares the child for school as basics about all the subjects taught in school are taken care of. It is also a place where children get an idea of their creativity and other interests. The importance of playgroup or preschool in a child’s life is many. We shall take a look at some of them.\nPlaygroups focus a lot on the development of a child, they use techniques enhanced specifically for this purpose. At such young age importance and focus should be given to the development of key physical features as well mental health too. Physical activities such as sports and games develop the muscles in the children’s body. At latter stages of preschool motor skills are given special importance; the stage by stage development of key aspects of a child plays a huge implication on the future growth and development of the child. So the importance of the kids’ playgroup cannot be neglected in developing a child to be a better and healthy human being for the future.\nThis is an important character for the success of an individual; team work is required for success in academics as well as work career. To hone these skills at an early age is an advantage for the child’s future. Playgroups focus on team work by making the children work in groups and also making them complete tasks and perform activities in a group. It also helps them build bonds which is an important aspect of growing up. This also builds up respects for one’s fellow human being.\nSince playgroups focus on the development of a child rather than mold them into something specific the curriculum is based on key aspects and characters that a child needs. This makes the learning experience fun and life lessons are learned. Everything is designed to keep the child interested, from furniture to the teaching techniques utilized everything is child centered.\nDiscipline is easy to enforce with strict rules and harsh punishments, but its relatively tough task to make children understand it and develop self discipline. This is where the brilliance of playgroups comes into play; since the environment is so child centered the children develop respect towards teachers and fellow students along with a sense of self control which leads to developing self discipline."

The area’s centerpiece is the ornate train depot that was designed by architect Daniel Burnham.\nWe have a strong automotive history that goes as far back as the late 1890s. That fact is well documented through displays at the Wayne County Historical Museum and the Model-T Museum.\nWe are known as the cradle of jazz music because of the numbers of famous musicians that began or boosted their careers at Gennett Records. Hoagy Carmichael recorded “Stardust” there.\nGennett even has a lasting legacy in movies: If you hear the sounds of glass crunching or train coming, it was probably recorded there.\nWe have a unique part in film history: The first public showing of a motion picture took place in 1894 at a jewelry store in downtown Richmond.\nAs recently as the 1990s, we were probably the smallest city in the world to have its own symphony, opera and civic theater.\nThere’s simply no question, though, that our town of about 37,000 has an artistic legacy that should be is the envy of those big and small around the world. The Richmond Art Museum is believed to be the only one that’s attached to an active high school. Richmond started an orchestra 1899, the first in the country for a high school.\nWe have many important museums with unique offerings: Mummies can be found at the Wayne County Historical Museum and at Earlham College’s Joseph Moore Museum. There’s only one other in Indiana.\nThe pottery and other popular works of the four Overbeck Sisters can be viewed in the county museum and Cambridge City Library."

        "text": "One bowl meals seem to be on every menu now, and we understand why. Filled with grains or noodles, veggies, and protein, one bowl meals are healthy and filling, which is a winning weeknight combo. If you’re looking for a rice bowl recipe, we’ve got plenty, like Cuban Black Bean-and-Yellow Rice Bowls and low-carb Skirt Steak and Cauliflower Rice bowls. Going meatless? Try veggie bowl recipes like Couscous Pilaf with Roasted Carrots, Chicken, and Feta or Farro Bowls with Curry-Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Brussels Sprouts. We could never forget about ramen and noodle bowl recipes, though. If you think you can’t make Asian cuisine at home, think again. With easy recipes like Slow-Cooker Ramen Bowls and Chicken Noodle Bowls with Peanut-Ginger Sauce, you can throw that takeout menu in the trash. Get a healthy, well-rounded meal all in one bowl with these recipes. Your weeknights just got jam-packed with one-bowl goodness.\nThis colorful, meatless bowl manages to pack in a little sweet, salty, and spicy. A tip from the Test Kitchen: Plantains are ready to cook when their peels turn black on the outside, so buy them black or let them ripen before cooking. Many grocery stores sell heat-and-serve frozen plantains too.\nCraving Asian flavor? This bright bowl is the healthiest way to get it. It’s got a hint of heat and a whole lot of goodness. A tip from the Test Kitchen: Don’t ignore the instruction about patting the shrimp dry before putting them in the skillet. This step keeps the shrimp from becoming soggy while cooking and ensures they’ll brown more nicely for the best flavor.\nPork tenderloin is a family weeknight favorite, and this hearty, healthy bowl should be next on your recipe list. Healthy whole-grain farro and a salad of Brussels sprouts, fennel, and shallots are a beautiful combination. Add crunchy chopped apples and a star-of-the-show vinaigrette, and you’ve officially outdone yourself.\nTrying to give up starchy rice and bread? With low-carb cauliflower rice, you won’t miss them for a beat, and many stores sell it ready-to-go now. Paired with skirt steak, red pepper sauce, and a bit of arugula, and you’ve got a well-rounded, filling dinner.\nGot a Costco rotisserie chicken you haven’t used up yet? Here’s what to do with it. The lemon-brown butter sauce in this recipe is to die for, and you can even use baby carrots to save you time chopping and peeling.\nTurn taco Tuesday around this week and make burrito bowls instead. This healthy option is full of customizable ingredients, so every family member gets exactly what they like. With premade ingredients like microwaveable brown rice, this is the fastest recipe you’ll make all week.\nThis recipe seems too easy to be true, but we wouldn’t lie to you. Simply mix together the sauce and cook the rest of the ingredients in a large skillet or wok. Serve over microwaveable Jasmine rice for ease, and you’ve got the most flavorful meal of the week on the table.\nWhether you serve it in the morning or it’s breakfast-for-dinner night at your house, these breakfast bowls will be a hit. Made with Buttermilk Stone-Ground Grits and topped with Tex-Mex elements like green chiles, pico de gallo, and cilantro, this bowl shakes breakfast up. Don’t forget to top it with a fried egg (or two!).\nTry out meatless Monday and fill up with this hearty, healthy bowl. To make things easier on you, the farro can be cooked up to two days in advance and stored in the refrigerator. With the seasoning combinations in this dish, your family will think you picked it up from a five-star restaurant.\nInstead of picking up ramen on your way home, have it ready and waiting for you with the help of your slow cooker. Low, slow cooking makes for the most flavorful broth.\nBring the Mediterranean home with this quick, easy recipe. If you have leftovers, Greek meatball pitas with cucumber-yogurt sauce would make a delicious lunch the next day. And we all know meatballs freeze beautifully, so make several batches to save for hectic weeks.\nCozy up with these chicken noodle bowls when you need a quick comfort meal. Adding fresh lime juice just before serving adds bright flavor to this healthy bowl.\nWhen the schedule is full, the slow cooker is there to help with dinner. With fall-off-the-bone roast and all the toppings you could want, these dinner bowls are filling and kid-friendly.\nIf your family loves classic shrimp and grits, imagine how much they’ll love it when it’s made with buttermilk (and parmesan) grits, country ham, and creole seasoning. Yes, yes, and yes.\nYour family will never know how easy this 20-minute recipe was to cook. If you like a kick, this the noodle bowl for you. Add a squeeze of lime juice just before serving for a hint of bright flavor.\nWhen in doubt, get the slow cooker out. The steak and vegetables slow cook together for a savory, rich result. Serve over yellow rice (white or brown rice or egg noodles work, too) to complete the meal.\nThis Tex-Mex bowl is bursting with color and healthy ingredients. Top with freshly sliced avocado and pair with a margarita or Mexican beer because you’ll want to toast to this delicious recipe.\nCan’t stop thinking about that Thai peanut sauce you love? Make a healthy version at home and drizzle it over colorful veggies and filling chicken (all ready in just 20 minutes). Craving, satisfied.\nThis 30-minute recipe is company-worthy but easy enough to serve on a casual weeknight. A tip from the Test Kitchen: Look for dry-packed scallops, which are packed without extra water or preservatives. This helps them brown nicely when cooked. Dry-packed scallops have a shorter shelf life than wet-packed scallops, so cook them the day you buy them.\nThere’s a chance you have a pork tenderloin sitting in your refrigerator or freezer that you plan on cooking this week. Instead of going the usual route, make a flavorful stir-fry with it. If you’ve never made bok choy before, it’s time to start. It’s full of healthy benefits like vitamins, potassium, calcium, iron, folate, fiber, and antioxidants."

After he moved to Brooklyn, Dmitriy was exposed to orthodox Judaism and became an observant Jew. He strictly follows Jewish law – if he has a fight on a Saturday, it must begin after sundown, the end of the sabbath. Dmitriy said, “Anyone who wants a good whuppin’ from me is just going to have to wait until sundown.” There are as many as 70 Jewish holy days on which he will not fight, and he follows Jewish dietary laws. When he’s training, he stays within walking distance of a synagogue for Friday and Saturday services – he’s not allowed to drive on the sabbath.\nHe started boxing at the age of 13 at the Starrett City Boxing Club, which is run by Jimmy O’Pharrow; Jimmy said, “My gym’s like a league of nations. I seen every kind of kid come through the doors, but I ain’t never seen one like this Dmitriy. Kid looks Russian, prays Jewish and fights black.”…Dmitriy said, “Jimmy runs an old school gym, a ghetto gym. My style isn’t European. It isn’t even American. It’s a city style. It’s black. I don’t know how else to say it. But some of us white boys got it like that.”…the radio at Starrett was always tuned to HOT 97; Dmitriy described it as “Blasting. A lot of Biggie. A lot of Tupac. I think that changed my style. That’s what gave me some rhythm.” …Dmitriy had a reported amateur record of 59-5."

Imagine a business that thrives on a high performing culture, where employees want to continuously improve their performance to achieve more. Imagine a company that supports and encourages it’s leaders to flourish in challenging and pressurised environments, and to create the leaders of the future within their teams. Corporate resilience.\nWelcome to a resilient organisation.\nBuilding corporate resilience has been described as the missing link in creating success in an organisation. Helping people within a business to hone their resilience mindset will improve employee health and wellbeing, engagement, productivity and performance.\nResilient leaders are exceptional leaders. They have the ability to lead expertly their teams in times of change and in pressurised environments, creating tangible results for the business. Leading can be challenging at times, and mastering a resilient mindset helps leaders deal with the unique pressures they face by adopting a confident and flexible approach.\nA resilient team are much more likely to reach their potential.\nEnhancing psychological resilience will enable sales and business development teams to effectively deal with challenges and knock-backs, and use these experiences as a catalyst to enhance future performance. Customer service professionals will have the psychological flexibility required to shift their perspective and provide exceptional customer service in challenging situations. Teams will work more cohesively, focusing on solving problems and continually improving their personal and collective performance.\nIf you want to create business success, can you afford not to build a resilient workforce?\nAt Kona Coaching we focus on creating tangible and measurable outcomes for the individual and business. In whichever way we partner with organisations, we focus on three factors: strong, sustainable success.\nWHEN DO WE NEED TO DRAW ON OUR RESILIENCE RESERVES?\nPressure can be the catalyst for performing at our peak, boosting performance and achieving goals and targets. At times however, the balance can tip more towards creating psychological stress rather than healthy pressure, and it’s at this point our performance at work, our health and wellbeing and our relationships will be affected.\nThe key is to firstly understand your personal pressures, the challenges you face and the obstacles you come across, both within your professional and your personal life, before moving on to tackling the challenge of enhancing your personal resilience levels. Mastering how you mentally process these situations, and changing your perspective to serve you better will encourage you to use these experiences as a catalyst to thrive and drive forward.\nSome of us thrive in a changeable environment, and for others we dread change and find an unstable environment exhausting. In today’s employment market, we’d be hard pressed to find an organisation or industry that isn’t changing in some way. Now more than ever, it’s important for us to equip ourselves and our teams with the skills and tools to navigate our way successfully through times of change.\nIncreasing your resilience levels in times of change enables you to flex your adaptability skills and switch your perspective to achieve the best from each situation you find yourself in. Finding the confidence to deal with challenges, and the acceptance to effectively cope with obstacles will help you to succeed in reaching your goals at work, no matter what kind of change is going on around you.\nAs a leader in an organisation or a team, at times the pressure can be intense. Often when we step into a leadership role we focus on honing the practical skills it takes to be a successful leader, but we neglect to grow our leadership mindset. For those that lead teams and individuals, you’ll understand the balancing act between being responsible for creating and executing a strategy, and supporting and guiding others to achieve team and individual goals.\nA resilient leader is likely to deal with challenges effectively, have the ability to energise and motivate their team and the foresight to make strategic decisions that will enhance their business. Leaders are faced with unique challenges, sometimes difficult decisions and potentially stressful situations, that if approached with a resilient mindset and dealt with effectively, can optimise their own success and enhance their team’s performance. Resilient leaders are in a key position to make an impact in their role, drive their business forward successfully and develop a resilient and high-performing team.\nWhether you’re an experienced or new leader, developing your leadership mindset is crucial in creating your leadership stamina. Leadership in itself is a skill, and exceptional leadership is supported by all six of the Resilience Edge™ facets: confidence, adaptability, positivity, perspective, mastery and stamina.\nWhat’s the one key characteristic that sets successful sales professionals aside from the competition? Resilience. Or more accurately a Resilience Edge™.\nThe world of sales can be exciting, energised and rewarding, and at times challenging and stressful. In a world of targets, goals, celebrated success and competitiveness, it can be hard to stay on-track when things aren’t going to plan, or when you feel you’ve been knocked off-course.\nResilient sales teams not only perform better and meet or exceed their sales targets, they also respond positively to challenges and keep moving forward despite being faced with difficult situations and challenges day to day. The sales environment isn’t changing – there will always be unique challenges to deal with. What you can change is how you respond to these situations, and a resilient mindset enables sales teams to flourish in the face of adverse circumstances.\nResearch tells us that a more resilient sales team is a more productive team. In a pressurised, results-driven employment market, a resilient mindset is your missing link in creating long-term success in a sales role. Crucially, your resilience is the difference between mediocrity and success.\nA resilient team are a cohesive unit that work well together, achieve targets and collectively perform to a high standard. Not only is a resilient team a high-performing team, but a resilient mindset also improves overall wellbeing and creativity, and reduces stress and anxiety.\nResilient teams are made up of people with an adaptable and flexible mindset, those who are able to respond to challenges effectively and turn difficult situations into opportunities to thrive. Not only are resilient teams more likely to succeed and perform better, they’re more likely to be healthy physically and mentally. Their immunity levels will be higher, which means less absenteeism due to illness (including stress), higher motivation and increased satisfaction with their working life.\nThe secrets to boosting your personal resilience lie with focusing on creating a strong, flexible mindset, and building sustainable resilience for the long-term. Not only will boosting your personal resilience encourage you to thrive at work, the skills you learn will positively impact other areas of your life too.\nHOW CAN YOU BOOST RESILIENCE AT WORK?\nOur training and coaching programmes are designed to make a big impact and create tangible, measurable and sustainable results for the business and the individual. We’ll work with you to define your organisational and individual outcome requirements, and we’ll design a bespoke corporate resilience programme for your organisation.\nOur consultants will define how we will measure the impact of our programmes right at the start of the design process – so you’ll be clear on the results you’ll see and the impact that will be made in the business.\nNo matter what positive outcomes you want to create from enhancing corporate resilience, our team of psychologists will design the right programme for your organisation. It may be a long-term training or coaching programme, or a one-off awareness course – either way it will be the right fit for your business.\nWe deliver our programmes in various ways. You may prefer traditional face-to-face learning experiences, one-to-one coaching, online bite-sized modules or a blended learning approach. Either way, we’ve got it covered, and we pride ourselves on our innovative approach to helping individuals learn and develop to create real results.\nWorking with new and experienced leaders to take their success from a practical leadership level to an enhanced transformational leadership standard, focusing on creating a leadership mindset, and leadership mastery and stamina. Not only are leaders responsible for their own success, but the success of the organisation they’re part of. Enhancing resilience will encourage leaders to drive forward, deal with pressures and create resilient and thriving teams. This population can benefit from group training, one-to-one coaching and team workshops.\nSales and business development professionals consistently rely on their personal resilience resources day after day. If resilience reserves start to run low, or if they find themselves in particularly challenging situations, the ability to hone their resilience mindset will be the difference between success and reaching breaking point. We work with sales professionals in a group training environment and on a one-to-one basis.\nIn the changeable, pressurised and constantly developing employment market we’re in today, a focus on team and individual resilience and wellbeing is crucial in building a strong, healthy and happy workforce. Enhancing resilience can increase employee satisfaction and engagement, reduce sickness absence and turnover, boost personal wellbeing, reduce stress and enhance performance. We work with individuals to enhance their personal resilience levels in a group and one-to-one capacity.\nSometimes you have the spark of an idea, or you know what you want to achieve, but you need expert support to reach corporate goals. Our resilience psychologists will work with you to create and embed a resilient culture in your organisation, focusing on tangible outcomes for the business and individual.\nTo find out more about our Resilience Edge™ programmes or to book a Resilience Edge™ consultation, email us at info@konacoaching.com or send us a message using the form below and we’ll be in touch as soon as possible (either via email or phone if you include your phone number in the message).\nWe’ll be happy to provide you with tips and advice, and we can fill you in on example programmes and suggested formats that will fit with your organisation."

Tom Carper (D-Del.), the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) of 2019 would reauthorize the program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through 2024 to assist firms with rebuilding or retrofitting diesel engines. The objective is for those updated engines to be able to comply with pollution standards.\nThe Environment and Public Works panel advanced the measure to the floor of the Senate by voice vote. Carper, the panel’s ranking Democrat, had initially authored the bill more than a decade ago with former Ohio Sen. George Voinovich (R).\n“With today’s vote, we’re one step closer to making sure this bipartisan tradition, imagined and incepted by my dear friend Sen.

Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, along with Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.\nSenate floor managers have yet to schedule a floor vote for the bill. In March, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers unveiled their version.\n“This is a critical piece of legislation that helps address the climate crisis and makes our diesel cars and trucks more fuel efficient,” said Rep.

        "text": "There’s nothing as unsightly on your face as a large blackhead – with the exception of a large whitehead. Both these blemishes result from clogged pores, but the blackhead occurs because the oil and dead skin cells are exposed to the air, forming the dark plug. A whitehead – the classic “zit” – is not open to the air, and the gunk is beneath the skin. While you’re tempted to pop either type to get rid of them, resist the temptation. That can cause infection and scarring. As with most issues in life, prevention is easier than the cure. Remember the first rule of skincare: Never go to bed with your makeup on.\nWhile it’s impossible to prevent every blackhead from forming, you can keep them to a minimum with due diligence. The first step is washing your face every morning and before you go to bed. If your skin is oily – which is likely the case if blackheads are a problem – use a cleanser containing salicylic acid. These products help clean pores and prevent breakouts. After washing, use a toner to ensure you get rid of every trace of grime or makeup.\nRegular exfoliating removes dead skin cells. Use a gentle rather than harsh formulation. The latter might irritate your skin, causing more blackheads and whiteheads to form. A good scrubbing with a washcloth in the shower is another effective exfoliant.\nBefore putting on makeup or going to bed, apply a product containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to absorb excess skin oil. While skincare items containing these ingredients are available over the counter, if you have a serious case of acne, visit a dermatologist to receive topical prescription medication.\nYou’ve probably seen the words “non-comedogenic” on moisturizers, sunscreens and face makeup. Those words simply mean the products won’t clog pores. If you’re prone to breakouts, only use non-comedogenic products on your skin. Even better – use items also labeled “hypoallergenic” in case your skin is especially sensitive.\nYour hands and fingers contain oils and bacteria that can cause blackheads and other skin eruptions. Train yourself to avoid touching your face.\nLay off the junk food and eat a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables. Start drinking eight glasses of water daily, and it’s a good bet you’ll see a great improvement in your complexion within a couple of weeks. If you follow these tips and are still plagued by blackheads, pay a visit to your dermatologist."

In that interview we had a chat with Keith Ward about his thoughts on social enterprise, social impact and social investment.\nDuring that event we also sat down and had a couple of short conversations with June O’Sullivan from London Early Years Foundation (LEYF) and Danny Dickson from Charity Bank.\nLEYF is one of the biggest childcare charities and social enterprises in Britain. For over 112 years they have been a catalyst for long-term social change by supporting the next generation of people that will shape our world to come. They are a family of 38 community-based nurseries across London and they support 48% of their parents with a free nursery place, allowing children from less affluent families access to early years education, which in turn allows their parents to work. This is just one of many examples of their social impact and the results certainly speak for themselves.\nJune has been involved with LEYF for about ten years and has been instrumental in driving major strategic and cultural change in the company, change which has led to increased profitability and profile within the last decade. She is an MBE, awarded for services to London’s children, and advises the government in their implementation of their vision for early years learning and support.\nCharity Bank needs little in the way of introduction. They are a bank whose mission is to support charities with finance that they are unable to find elsewhere, whilst demonstrating how people’s savings can be invested ethically, in positive ways. People can save with Charity Bank knowing that their money is doing good and is helping others in ethical ways. In an era where big banks are often met with suspicion, Charity Bank is out there showing how banks can, and should, work for good.\nDanny Dickson is the director for Charity Bank in Scotland and has only recently come into post. He has worked in banking for almost 40 years, and was a corporate relationship manager for Co-operative Bank in Glasgow, manging the portfolios of charities, credit unions, social enterprises, co-operatives and social landlords among others.\nBoth Danny and June have vast amounts of experience in social enterprise, and I think you get a sense of that in these very brief, but interesting, chats."

I arrived in Sal as the captain of a sailboat and sailed between the islands of Sal and Boa Vista regularly. I was lucky enough to experience the deep ocean and soon found hidden treasure.\nI moved on and started working with whales and dolphins here on the island of Sal on various boats. Very rewarding work in an environment which still does not suffer from commercial whale and dolphin watching. I was becoming more a part of the ocean than the land and I was becoming more aware of the damage caused to the ocean by human impact.\nI started to stand up paddle only a year ago. It appealed to me for so many reasons. I leave no pollution behind. I was tired of the noise and needed to spend the time alone with the ocean. I was happy I had found my own “vessel”. Standing up gives you a far clearer vision of not only your surroundings but also the ability to see into the water.\nI snorkel with my stand up, I fish off my stand up, I windsurf off my stand up, but most importantly it gives me the freedom to be me and go and explore this beautiful ocean.\nThis is the story of my circumnavigation around Sal on a stand up paddle to raise money for Castelos do Sal which is a charitable organisation created by volunteers which aims to promote the rights of vulnerable children, help meet their basic needs and contribute to their overall development.\nCastelos do Sal collaborates with state-owned projects in order to complement the work being done and stimulates various development programmes in education, health and nutrition. The association particularly targets the area of Santa Maria, the principal tourist town of the island of Sal as the main point of intervention.\nForecast: Southerly wind with a chance of showers.\nRoute for the day: Angulo Centre to Mt Leon.\nI started the day nice and early with a clear head, I had still not made the decision to leave. I picked up my board and gear and walked down the beach and to my surprise saw a friend of mine, Adrian. If he could make it to the beach at 6.30am, I could paddle around the island! Slowly but surely more figures appeared and I knew it was time.\nAt 7am I was off. Head down knowing full well the weatherman was telling stories again, I tried to fall into a rhythm.\nPonta Sino was the first test and did not fail to impress. I was 20 minutes from home and Ponta Sino was nasty, current and swell as well as a 10 knot northerly all straight into my face. I took around an hour to get around the corner and already she was playing games with my head.\nI stopped off at Ponta Preta and had some breakfast where the folks from C-Riders met up with me to wish me luck. I was recharged and ready. The paddle from Ponta Preta passed all the new hotels and was beautiful. Clean water and very interesting reef structures made for entertaining paddling with lots of fish and even the odd wave to be had.\nI was meeting my good friend Marie at Caletha Funda for lunch and was feeling good and getting ready for the next few days. My plans had changed as I knew the southerly wind was not going to happen. Marie was great, I heard what was to become a famous line of hers,” Don’t you think you should just push on as far as possible?” I did.\nIt was the first leg where I knew I was going offshore. The bay of Murdeira is fairly wide and I decided to paddle straight across about 1 mile to 1.5 miles offshore. It was a hard but good paddle. Mt Leon was my next stop and my night rest point.\nI was surprised not to see Marie on her quad when I arrived. I waited around for a while and then the thought occurred that perhaps she had broken down. I called her and heard a relieved voice on the other side. She then told me the funniest story about how she could no longer see me so she had gathered all the fishermen to count buoys and try to spot me. First day and she wanted to call the coast guard. Yeah right!\nMt Leon is a very special place on this planet and an amazing dinner and great night’s sleep was had at the foot of the mountain.\nForecast: North north east 10-12 knots.\nRoute: Mt Leon up to Burracona.\nThe shortest day’s paddle. Welcome to the north of the island.\nThe paddle past the cliffs at Mt Leon is one of the most special experiences anyone on Sal can have. The size, the splendour and the shadows mixed with crystal clear water with abundant fish and bird life is very peaceful. I made a decision to cut through the island, which was very interesting with currents and waves breaking in both directions.\nI stopped off at Alibaba for a short water break and paddled around the corner to Palmeira where I hooked up with Marie again who was off to buy supplies. We parted ways and planned to meet up at Buracona.\nAs soon as I paddled past Palmeira I started to notice the changes.\nOne bay had plenty of Ridleys turtles and 100m further something large circled around me, a tiger shark I think. I did not pay much attention and neither did it; we both had things to do. The landscape started to change and the coastline became pretty jagged. I was watching out for a keyhole (a place to enter and exit the water), but could not see anything that wouldn’t send you or your board to the clinic. I will never forget paddling around a point only to find 3 seagulls sitting on a rock staring at me wondering what the crazy South African guy was doing!\nFor some reason I stopped and that was when I noticed the lines of swell heading my way. I paddled up to Buracona but there was no way of exiting the water so I had to make a decision. I had no choice, I knew there was no way out for 20 kilometres ahead of me, I turned around. In my head I knew I had to do something special. This was it; this was what the north was about.\nI held up next to a cliff and watched the surge swell rise and fall. One second I was level with the cliff the next second I was admiring the shellfish living on the walls. I looked up and I was level with the land, I made a decision and I jumped. I threw my paddle on to the rocks and grabbed my leash. My board was hanging 25ft over the cliff. With every swell I managed to get it closer and on the third swell my board was back in my arms. I managed to walk up the rocks and about 300 metres to Buracona (what a relief) and Luciano and his great team of workers who made us feel really welcome – a big thank you goes out to them. I can’t wait to sit in the new restaurant in winter and admire the power of the swell!\nThe wind was getting fresher and the swell was building.\nWoke up to the sound of crashing waves and a fresh breeze. There was no way it was going to happen.\nMy good friend Dag from Norway came to join me as he was walking the north while I paddled around. We chatted to Luciano and a couple of the staff and their advice was that I actually go look at what I am going to try paddle.\nDag and I walked up the slope of Monte Leste to try and get a bigger picture. I wish we hadn’t, the big picture was nasty. The wind was doing at least 25 – 30 knots and we could make out current lines all over the place. With the heat up north a lot of thermal wind is created and it certainly has a micro climate of its own. It was hot, really hot and the conditions were starting to play mind games with me. It was time to chill, rest up and eat more than I have eaten in months.\nGreat night’s sleep with awesome stars.\nWe awoke to exactly the same conditions and made the decision to sit for another day.\nEmma, Karen and Duncan (local friends) came up with breakfast which was fantastic. Thanks guys. That evening we had a wonderful gathering and everyone hit the road. Cheryl, Laura, Marie and Linda (the girls and my support team) came up and we had a wonderful BBQ. A few beers later and it was time for everyone to get back to Santa Maria.\nWoke really early and went and had a good look at the conditions. It was on. I could not launch at Buracona due to some serious swell so I went back around the corner and jumped off the cliff. We had all planned to meet up on the northern tip Fiura.\nDag was walking with his dog and Laura was meeting Marie and driving around. I was a little nervous about the weather and was just hoping the wind would stay down for a few hours. I was so happy just to be back on the water, I had not paddled for 2 full days.\nThe landscape from the ocean is stunning. The whole North West coast is surrounded by reef which makes for some pretty awesome waves. It is an amazing feeling paddling on top of the reef which in some cases is less than a metre deep. The water drops off the reef to some incredible depths and I found myself staring into the blue watching shoals of fish feeding and being eaten.\nThe ocean over time teaches many lessons and awareness is one of the most important. You have to be aware of your position on the reef up north, it is really important. The ocean does not form waves but is rather just a huge mass of unbroken water that moves with great speed over the reef. At one stage I stopped for a water break and found myself being swept over the reef before the water bottle had even touched my lips. The wind was up and doing about 12 knots but the current was the true test.\nI made my way around what I thought was the northern tip only to find another point. I was getting confused as what I had seen from land I could now not place from the ocean. I was looking for the lighthouse but could not see it. I carried on…and on… and on. I knew I must have overshot the meeting point but there was no way I was turning back.\nAt the next bay I decided to paddle to shore to try and figure out where I was. I eventually realised I was staring at Monte Grande 406 metres above sea level and I was on the wrong side of the mountain. I remembered doing a calculation before the trip and figured I had about 7km to go before I reached Pedra Lume so I re-launched and had a fantastic paddle past some pretty jagged reef and cliffs. Families were out fishing and I could see their reactions to seeing a paddle board going by!\nIt was done, I had made the north but I knew that Dag was walking and with me overshooting the meeting point I started to worry about him. I pulled my board further up the beach and looked up the road to see Laura, Marie and Dag on the way down. Everyone was good and all in one piece. Needless to say, we had a couple of beers and a fantastic chicken BBQ.\nSet off fairly early knowing I had 25 km to do. Had been told that there were a lot of sharks off the wreck but did not come across any. I paddled further down admiring the beautiful little bays and coves along the way. I stopped at one of my favourites and had a good swim.\nI carried on down towards Sera Negra. The sharks were all sitting just north, I could not tell how many there were but when I looked out in front of me they were all swimming on the surface almost leading the way. I rounded the corner and saw Santa Maria.\nI had been away for 6 days and the realisation that this was soon going to be over hit home. I paddled past the turtle camp and decided to hit land to relax. It was still early and I was only 8km from the end. I decided to press on and rest up at Grijinha before the final leg.\nAt 4 that afternoon I put the board in the water for the last time. I sat off the point for a while and gave my own personal thanks to the ocean. As I rounded Ponta Leme I noticed a 4×4 speed up and a man with a very large camera get out and start filming. I then started hearing drums. I am an African, born and bred and the sound of the drums gave me instant goose bumps.\nAs I came within 200 metres of the beach I started to notice the people waiting for my arrival. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was about to come my way. Children, beautiful children from the charity rushed up to greet me, friends were shaking my hand and all around me people were smiling. I was pulled away from the crowd and before I knew it we were doing a live radio broadcast and then a TV crew did their thing.\nIt was an unbelievable vibe and the support from the community was fantastic, you can all be very proud of yourselves. I will never forget that afternoon as long as I live. We had done what we set out to do but what we had achieved in the way of bringing everyone together was also incredible.\nI would like to thank each and every person for sponsoring me; the money that was raised will go to such an important project.\nCheryl, Linda, Peter, Laura, Dag and especially Marie have to be mentioned. Without these people this trip would not have happened, well maybe it would have, but one thing is for sure, I would not have gained weight along the way! It is amazing knowing that we are all part of a community that cares.\nI would also like to thank Maria for giving me a SUP board for my 40th birthday; little did she know the monster she was creating! Also thank you to Josh Angulo for his support, as well as Ed Angulo for designing a great board. Thank you to a great friend of mine, a lion from Zimbabwe, Muche for all the hard paddle time, next time he will be by my side.\nTo everyone involved thank you and well done.\nNow any ideas for what next? If anyone is interested I would love to paddle around all the Islands in Cape Verde!\nCastelos do Sal is supported solely through donations: money, food, clothing and educational materials are always very welcome and are distributed accordingly to the families and children in need.\nSensuality, originality and spirit, this is what Mariana Ramos brings to an already impressive pantheon of Cape Verdean singers. Over the years, she has reinvented herself and kept her fans more enthusiastic than ever.\nMariana is eclectic too, easily gliding from one rhythm to the next. Her soulful voice effortlessly adapts from a robust “cola sanjõn” from the island of São Vicente, to a suave “coladeira”, and even an invigorating “funana” the most upbeat form of Cape Verdean music and a genre exclusive to the island of Santiago. This adaptability is a direct result of her upbringing, an upbringing which took her way beyond the archipelago.\nBorn in Dakar, in neighbouring Senegal, Mariana’s first encounters with music were with her father’s, the famous Cape Verdean musician Toy Ramos, aka Tony de Bibia, and with the varied Senegalese music she grew up with. Today, one can still hear the poignant Senegalese drums in some of her compositions.\nA few years later, she travelled to Cape Verde to live with “Bibia”, her beloved grandmother. The years spent in the popular district of “Monte Sossego”, on the island of São Vicente, had a profound impact on young Mariana, as this was where she got her first taste of Cape Verde’s impressive folklore and wide musical range. But it was in Europe, especially in Paris, where she later travelled to join her parents that Mariana performed for the first time. As soon as she was old enough, she joined a rock band, then a pop group before singing in a jazz quintet.\nShe is an avid learner of new sounds and styles and learnt with ease the repertoires of the greatest, from Edith Piaf to Rickie Lee Jones. Her early love affair with jazz has left a deep and soulful imprint on her singing style.\n“Di Dor Em Or” or “From Pain To Gold” marked the debut of her recording career in 2000. The album, released under the distinguished label “Morabeza Records” comprises ten tracks and was an instant hit. Of “Di Dor Em Or” Mariana says that she was very proud to be singing on such a prestigious label, which was started in the 1960s by her uncle and owned at the time by her brother. Indeed, many great names of African music have found worldwide recognition under “Morabeza Records” such as Bana, Bonga and Voz de Cabo Verde.\nIt was also during this time, that Mariana decided to explore her musical heritage and affirm her love for her country and its music. Acclaimed composers Téofilo Chantre and Nazalio Fortes became her collaborators as she eagerly embarked on this journey of self-discovery.\nEurope and Africa opened their arms to the Cape Verdean diva’s debut and soon a successful tour followed. Thanks to her charm and stage presence she quickly caught the eye of the famous French stage director, Richard Demarcy, who offered her a singing and acting role in “Oyé Lunan”, an Afro-Latino play which had tremendous success with over 600 shows throughout the world.\n“Bibia”, her second album released in 2004, is a tribute to her grandmothers who both carry this nickname and by the same token to her father, Tony de Bibia, with whom she had the opportunity to collaborate for the first time. The famous guitarist wrote four of the songs on the album which was more intimate and traditional than its predecessor.\nHer journey towards her origins led Mariana to her third album “Mornador”, which came out in 2008 and, according to the artist “best represents her universe”. Indeed, it was a labour of love and reflection. Six of the fifteen tracks were written by her, which proved that she was not only a voice to be reckoned with amongst other Cape Verdean singers but also an excellent song writer. “Mornador” was also the opportunity for Mariana to express herself in the many languages she speaks, demonstrating her multiculturalism and capacity to relate to different cultures and people. A bold move which was acclaimed by the media and finally granted Mariana worldwide recognition.\nIt was Mariana’s love of dancing which was the inspiration for her latest album, “Suavidança” released in February 2011, a more upbeat style of music, which comprises subtle arrangements and more intricate compositions.\nHer passion for her country and Africa in general is obvious with the song “Nzinga Mbandi”, dedicated to the Angolan queen – which she sings with Benin superstar Angelique Kidjo. When those two powerful African voices meet on this catchy track, magic happens and one feels oneself travelling back to the times of this Angolan heroine.\nOver the years, Mariana Ramos has successfully established herself as one of the most interesting Cape Verdean artists. Her music represents her roots, her travels, her passions. It is refreshing, sassy and captivating, enriched by all the influences that have seduced her and which will undoubtedly seduce many listeners too.\nYou are currently browsing the the Cape Verdean blog archives for February, 2013."

        "text": "It's official, I love fall.\nI love everything about it (probably because it does not snow where I live).\nI love the colors of the leaves on the ground, the orange mums and pumpkins.\nI even love pumpkin ice cream.\nThe thing I have noticed this year is that gray is everywhere. It made it's way into the market place more than a year ago and it's still going strong and has permeated everything design related. Since that's part of my job...to notice trends in the industry, I think I have been taken in hook, line and sinker. Throw the anchor overboard! I'm staying here with gray for a while!\nNow you might be thinking...what in the heck does gray have to do with fall? other than maybe the color of the sky. But I think it has a lot to do with it because it is the perfect neutral for the color orange, my favorite fall color.\nI decided to do my own little research to see what I could find in the perfect combination for fall.\ngray and orange were everywhere!\nto the nursery (love the big, bold stripe on the wall).\nI even found it in the office, making simple white shelves a knockout.\nGrey is everywhere in the wedding scene...gray with orange, gray with bright pink, gray with bright yellow. See for yourself.\nI love you so much orange leather tote bag, but why in heavens name do you have to cost $465?\nDon't you think the Orla Kiely orange tote would look great with this gray outfit from Banana Republic?\nIt has even made it's way to my house by way of new coverlets in the guest room, a new bench outside and a new project that's currently on the work table (more on that later).\nI have a very long porch and have always wanted a bench under the window but could never find one long enough (about 8 ft) so I made a little sketch and my husband built it from scratch. Then came time for paint. I looked at some different colors, black, red, creme, but then had an epiphany that I needed to paint it gray. So we went to Home Depot for some gray exterior paint with primer and once again, he made it happen.\nA couple week later, he sanded the bench to distress the edges and I glazed it with a some Ralph Lauren glaze that I had left over from another project. I don't believe they make the glaze anymore so stain could easily substituted. We finished it off with a spray varnish in matte.\nAnd now I have a bench on my porch in the fabulous shade of gray.\nLooks fabulous with the orange don't you think?\nWhat can you paint gray to get ready for fall?\nBeautiful! Erin recently painted her living room grey with yellow accents. Very trendy!\nI absolutely luv grey...I decided to redo our living room with greys, cremes and taupes...I hope it turns out good.\nI love your bench and yes, it looks wonderful with the pumpkins! Grey and yellow are one of my favorite color combos and now grey and orange is too!\nThat grey & orange wedding is LUSCIOUS !! I too love Fall and love the fact that it is followed by Winter complete with snow !!! You think grey is beautiful, you need to see fluffy white goodness. On a sunny day or dark night, it is perfection !!! Have a happy one !!\nHello, Paula-- Ha! love this Grey trend. Turns out it fits in high summer in S.A. too- Last week we approved the final colour for our exterior house repaint (starts tomorrow & I am dreading it)colour called \"Fynbos\". Ring any bells?\nGrey has always been big here in France; its nuance is endless.\nLOVE THE BENCH...Gold star for hubby!\nHi Paula, I have a yellow house with a long table in front of the window on the front porch. It has been black for ages but you just inspired me to go gray.l Front door tool And it won't show the dust as much. Bonus! Thanks.\nI hope you like the gray! Every time I walk by the bench I just love it. Also had so many great comments about it from friends. Love to see a picture when your done!\nFabulous inspiration. That bag is gorgeous...but expensive...but I really love it! Love the bench!\nYes Paula, I will send a picture! Just sent my hubbie out for pumpkins. (Copy catting you as usual).\nThe bench looks great Paula! Way to go hubby!!"

Twitter would be ablaze, journalists outraged, and questions asked in parliament!\nYet just this week alone, a similar fate has befallen two bloggers, and the silence is deafening – even from within the blogosphere.\nThe blogsite ‘Nutsville’ has upset the Westminster Council head of legal, Peter Large. Quite apart from the usual threats of action for defamation, including demands to the web host asking them to censor the posts – they have also blocked the web site from being read in council premises, which include public libraries. The FOI request that has been sent to the council asking for the reasons behind this move – and pointing out that it may be in partial violation of The Human Rights Act 1998, Article 10, Freedom of Expression – must be answered by 23rd February, and may also produce a list of other political sites blocked by the council, which should be of interest.\nYou may want to read the full story on Nutsville’s own site.\nUp in Rutland, a similar fate has befallen Martin Brookes, who specialises in stories regarding his local Rutland Council.

Having solid learning of SEO is not really adequate now and again. Regardless of whether you are doing your best to endeavor to acquire a decent positioning for your site, you may in any case end up asking why your site is just not doing admirably. First off, you should comprehend that your site should be completely upgraded in all components. Not simply that, but rather your site must be kept up all the time. Website optimization is a constant procedure that incorporates a lot of time and exertion. To make things less difficult, you will be in an ideal situation using the administrations of an equipped SEO organization to take the necessary steps for your site.\nThere are various SEO organizations today, and there are a great deal of dependable organizations and in addition questionable ones. Along these lines, it is pivotal that you select the ideal SEO Company. Here are 10 vital focuses that you should remember while choosing SEO administrations: Does the SEO firm offer you a site assessment manage? A dependable SEO firm ought to be able to furnish you with a broad investigation of your site, in regards to positioning and configuration structure. This should be possible by playing out a site review. The consequence of this site review will permit the SEO firm to offer you a proposition of how much function should be done to convey you to a specific level of positioning. They should have the capacity to exhort and investigate all viewpoints identified with execution, substance, and outline that may prevent the perusing or ordering of your pages.\nA reliable SEO Company won’t simply give you a statement once they make sense of how much function must be incorporated. Charging you high expenses won’t really guarantee you get excellent administrations. It likewise doesn’t guarantee that the rate being cited is corresponding and predictable with the administrations you foresee the SEO Company will give. A decent SEO Agency ought to have the capacity to give you an once-over of administrations to which the execution and value contract will be founded on. Does your SEO Company furnish you with a course of events? It is through diligent work and right arranging that outcomes can be accomplished on time. Some SEO Firms offer SEO designs that case to place you in the specific first page of indexed lists in simply a question of 10 days. Reasonably, in any case, no SEO Company can promise you the number 1 position in Google in as short as 10 days.\nA SEO crusade will take 6-year and a half to convey the best results you anticipate. Ensure you don’t surrender to false promises. Then again, maintain a strategic distance from SEO administrations that furnish you with a period restrict. A decent SEO organization realizes that enhancement is a progressing procedure and they ought to have the capacity to offer you customary upkeep, client bolster and legitimate overhauling.What SEO technique will your SEO Company use to raise your positioning? You should pay special mind to organizations that will use spam publicizing strategies to rank you on top in the blink of an eye. In the event that the technique incorporates any type of deceptive practice, for example, spamming or deluding on the web crawlers, at that point you ought to immediately dismiss.\nYou don’t need insignificant movement that goes to your site due to unimportant watchwords. Unfit activity just upgrades your skip rate (surfers that land on your page and promptly leave) and not your deals. The privilege SEO Company will make important substance for your site and convey it to applicable stations, internet based life and Press Releases (PR). This will conceivably prompt regular backlinks that will improve your general positioning in the web index. An expert SEO Company ought to have an unmistakable game-plan to achieve the coveted outcomes in a given time span. They ought to have the capacity to demonstrate the customer what’s being finished for the primary month and ensuing months. With this, you will have the capacity to decide how much function is being done in connection to your expenses, enabling you to decide your ROI. An unmistakable diagram of work in the proposition ought to be accessible whenever to demonstrate the degree of the crusade. This incorporates how much crisp and great applicable substance they will distribute on your site each week. What number of conveyance channels? What internet based life, article registries and sites would they say they will use to appropriate your substance? What number of PR entries? What’s more, what number of backlinks have been created? These are the qualifying questions that should be replied by a decent SEO firm.\nAt the point when an organization embraces a site improvement program, regardless of whether it is performed in-house or outsourced to a SEO benefit, the vast majority of the consideration (and as it should be) is centered around the organization site. This is the one angle where there is a sentiment of control- – once a site is discharged into the wild, the organization should perceive how its webpage admissions against the various sites out there, regardless of whether alternate locales are utilizing moral SEO strategies or not.\nAside from changes made to the organization site, the presumption is frequently that the organization and, on the off chance that it is utilizing one, its SEO benefit, has zero authority over what shows up in web crawler results. Be that as it may, this isn’t normally the case. Regularly, you or your SEO companies administration can directly affect web index results by observing your rivals and announcing them to the significant web crawlers when the SEO methods utilized on their website fall outside what is prevalently alluded to as moral SEO. (If it’s not too much trouble take note of that while I trust that “moral” is hurled around time and again, “moral SEO” has turned into the standard expression to portray white cap strategies, thus it is the expression I use all through the article.\nTo begin with, how about we characterize contenders. Relatively every organization has somewhere around a bunch of different organizations that it considers to be essential contenders – the ones that offer similar items and administrations, that are of comparative size, et cetera. It is essential that the SEO endeavors (or deficiency in that department) of these contenders, regardless of whether they are utilizing moral SEO systems or not, be checked on a standard premise. In the event that they have not enlisted their very own SEO administration, or in the event that they have not begun doing SEO in-house by any stretch of the imagination, you will have genuine feelings of serenity realizing that the utilization of this channel, for the occasion, is yours. In the event that your rivals start a SEO battle, with or without an outside SEO benefit, you can find out much about their deals and promoting strategies by assessing the keyphrases that they target. What’s more, you can likewise examine whether they are utilizing moral SEO hones in their crusade.\nIt’s vital to remember that it is far-fetched that searchers will choose just among you and the essential contenders you have recorded. They will consider any organization that matches their specific needs and that appears for their inquiry term. This is the reason your criteria for a contender online should expand to incorporate any organization that offers items or administrations like yours that outranks you for any of your focused on keyphrases. On the off chance that your in-house staff or your SEO benefit persistently screens your web index positions as well as breaks down the organizations that show up above you in query items, you can frequently distinguish forward-looking contenders of which you were already ignorant – your essential rivals of tomorrow.\nThis conveys us to the key issue of moral SEO. Website streamlining is as yet another idea to generally organizations. Indeed, even the most regarded organizations can commit errors in this field, either by picking the wrong SEO benefit, or by endeavoring to abstain from contracting a SEO benefit through and through by getting it house with good natured however unfit individuals. For instance, BMW’s German site was as of late expelled incidentally from the Google file for utilizing entryway pages- – something that isn’t viewed as a moral SEO hone. It makes sense that your rivals are likewise not safe to infringement.\nThe liberal people at Google give a free catchphrase look into apparatus that is ignored by numerous online advertisers. In the online world it is a misstep to live by the familiar saying “you get what you pay for.” The fact of the matter is there are many free or minimal effort options in contrast to most advertising devices. Obviously paying a few hundred dollars every year for a superior apparatus like Wordtrack is justified, despite all the trouble… on the off chance that you are doing the volume of showcasing to legitimize it and have the financial plan. I trust Google Keyword Tool is an incredible place for most advertisers to begin. Read more to realize why.\nThe data in Google Keyword instrument is 100% Google information work from the api google search that individuals are paying for on Google. The device is worked to enable people to design their AdWords battles; be that as it may, it is a ground-breaking apparatus for any distributer. The hypothesis is strong. On the off chance that people are paying for the catchphrases, they should see a ROI. GKT likewise incorporates some fundamental instruments to enable you to distil your rundown and discover the watchwords that are best for your task. The program will reveal to you how much rivalry there is for every catchphrase or watchword state. This ought to be the beginning stage of all great catchphrase inquire about.

For what reason is this essential? The reason is that if people are paying for these watchwords they are clearly getting looked and tapped on. This is relatively similar to a KEI perusing that more costly instruments like Wordtracker give.\nSubsequent to blending down your rundown of potential outcomes to a rundown of catchphrases that have moderately high ventures and low rivalry, the following stage is to channel the rundown down to words that are proper for you anticipate. You will have the choice to sift through specific words that you don’t need.

Clients don’t need you to just publicize, or they will rapidly lose intrigue. Surely you should keep your substance like what your business is about, yet keep it intriguing, as well. Try not to exhaust your clients with ads, and don’t sound limited time constantly. Online networking instructing for Facebook is as basic as following the above tips. Inside only a couple of months you should begin to see a major distinction and will get a few outcomes for your endeavors. From that point, you simply need to prop it up by staying predictable, posting as often as possible (in any event once every day), and engaging your clients."

        "text": "The homely heart of Happy Dog! Started as a trial in 2001 to see if a dog walking business would work, we look back after almost 18 years and reflect on that we not only started the very FIRST professional Dog Walking service in New Zealand, but have had the unique privelege, pleasure and company of many loved dogs. The total dog walks in these years past is now around 45,000! The journey is to this day, a true life joy! The company of dogs is hard to beat at any time so being part of a group of close friends is a thing of beauty, joy and incredible insight into the behavioural world of dogs.\nThe responsibility of taking your pet out is not looked upon lightly. The study and training undertaken by us has put us in a position to call ourselves professional. To alleviate the stressors of life, from the viewpoint of a dog, is one of our highest priorities. Sadly this is overlooked by so many walkers and day care facilities that have come after us.\nOur TRANSPORT is safe, with each dog being housed independantly which is a reducer of stress even before the walk begins. At Happy Dog we make a point of highlighting the importance of safe transport. It just crucial!\nOur walk environment has also proven itself to be very safe after all these years.\nOnce we have met and been introduced to your dog we will take him/her along for a FREE intro walk. This is done for both your dogs mental well-being (meeting me first is a great start point for a bond that will grow..) and to match their the personality to an existing social construct of the group into which they might join. The walk has to be fun for the dog and a positive first impression with me makes a world of difference to the whole bonding process. PLEASE NOTE: Dogs walked by us must be of a social nature.\nYour pet will then be booked in. Picked up from home in our custom built van on the arranged day(s) and taken for a two-hour walk at varying locations. Afterwards your tired but satisfied pet is returned home. What we have found through the years is that dogs feel great when they all know one another, this in turn creates harmony, increases confidence, lower stress and stimulates socialisation.\nExperience has shown that after a period with us, a dog will likely become more socially confidant (if not already!) and less likely to react adversly to random (canine) anomalies within their direct environment. This is not only due to 'the walk', but also due to the non-confrontational environment in which your dog finds itself. In short, it all comes down to 'speaking', and 'interpretting' their own language better. He/she starts to look forward to its walking schedule. This sums up in short what Happy Dog walking service does. Still we all know that every dog is different and this is also taken into account. Aspects such as medical condition and/or age are watched closely, as is general physical condition. You will be informed directly should anything out of the ordinary be noticed.\nSocialisation of your dog in a group situation in a stress-free, non confrontational environment. i.e. space to look away and or move away (as dogs do need this choice)!\nThe place to be a dog with other dogs in a non-contained environment i.e. room to find its own space if needed.\nRemember: Always 'read' your dog after activity to see if they liked it! Even better is to watch them whilst being out and about...We'll do our best to provide regular videoed updates.\n* The booking fee applies to the reservation of the walking space within the group. This is a fixed weekly cost, even during a pets abscence except for reasons that are medical or illness related.\n\"Dogs feel very strongly that they should always go with you in your car, in case the need should arise for them to bark violently at nothing right in your ear.\""

        "text": "A good looking sedan! If I were in a different position, I'd be more than happy to take it off your hands!\nwhen I bought my 86 wagon....for under 100$....I had to buy my wife a dog that cost hundreds to shut her up....We had the dog for 6 months when he thought he was a kamakazi piolet and jumped out the window of my wifes car on the freeway....we are dogless once again....this mean I can bring home yet another eagle as long as there is a puppy with a bow riding shotgun!\nSo when exactly are you coming back? Chances are I'll have something available for purchase at that time. Could be this sedan, could be something else. My '86 wagon might even be on the block, you never know.\nAfter all these months, I finally have a bit of progress to report.\nShortly after I acquired it, one of our local AMC club members came over and gave the paint job a professional grade facelift. I was amazed at how the paint bounced back after 30 years of wear and tear. The only downside was that all of the bumps and bruises the car had accumulated over the years stood out even more against a shiny background. The part below the black rub strips wasn't touched - it was too far gone to rejuvenate. That area will simply be painted black.\nOther than that bit of attention, this car has sat out behind my garage essentially untouched for the past eight months. Only in the past week or two have I been able to finally dive into it in any detail, with help from Whuntmore.\nThe driver's door was sagging badly, and we got that realigned. I had to replace the body half of the lower hinge, as it was ovaled out pretty good. Four new bushings were installed, and the whole door had to be shifted back and pivoted upward slightly at the rear so it would close properly again. This also evened out the panel gaps between the doors and fender.\nI knew this car had rust in the rockers, but it's a lot worse than I first suspected. I've spent a few hours just pulling out bits of rusty metal. I should have taken a picture of the pile I had on the ground after that session - and that was just after doing most of the passenger side. The outer rockers are solid for the most part, but the inners succumbed to rust big time. I would have preferred the other way around.\nMechanically there isn't much to complain about. When I first drove it home in September, the transmission shuddered when first starting to drive and the brakes were horrendous. They pulled to the right in a major way when applied. Both of these problems seem to have rectified themselves over the past few months, although I'll still look at the brakes more closely. The car needs 5 or 6 minutes of warmup time before it'll move anywhere. After that, it drives just fine.\nyou could post some pictures of the rust holes.\nActually, it's funny but there's more rust on the inner rockers, then the outers. The outer rockers are really good, but the inners are pretty bad. EM would need to do some serious welding and patching.\nThe nice thing is that it's mostly hidden areas, so that's good.\nOtherwise, the car isn't bad at all... it's been neglected for several years, but the thing still starts and moves. And it doesn't look horrible.\nAny chance you got the name of that magic stuff used on the paint?\nI thought about trying some simple polishing compound on my ride.\nseveral 3M products used, can't remember any of them.\nThanks anyway..........I'll try the P.C. in an inconspicuous area, if I can find one that's faded.\nI've had amazing results with a \"deoxidizer.\" Original paint forms a layer of oxidation on itself similar to rust. When its removed there is instant, staggering results. Its not the same thing as wax or polishing compound.\nSweet, sounds like less elbow grease too.\nEl Matador, that sedan may be a good candidate for an off-road rig because of the rust!?!\nThis is the best I can do for ya. Look for products that have similar bottles and lablels.\nI looked it up on the 3m site, and it does look to be part of a system, since it leaves swirl marks behind. I'll probably not invest that much into the paint right now, as mine has bumps and bruises as well.\nI put this car up for sale in August 2012. I had a few interested parties, but no follow through until September when a guy came out and gave me my full asking price ($650) without hesitation. He was a younger guy, but was very knowledgeable on the subtle nuances of older vehicles (like carburetors) and had apparently done quite a bit of reconstructive surgery on cars before.\nI showed him all of the rust, and was up front about the fact that although the car ran well, it was a project. He said it wouldn't be a problem, and as he drove off in it I felt good about where it was going.\nApparently I was wrong. Today I found out through a mutual acquaintance that the car was later scrapped.\nSo, the story is over for this one. All of my efforts were ultimately for nothing.\nI think the issue is, people get into these cars with good intentions, but quickly get in over their heads.\nExtensive bodywork can be very time-consuming, and can over-whelm even the best of us at times. and If your heart isn't really into the project - people can get put-off, and then opt for an easier project - or a car that has more readily available parts.\nI think that's what happened here. Some guy thought, \"yeah, this would be cool to mod out\" and then after a few weeks of looking into it, realized just how much work this project would be."

        "text": "Opinions differ when it comes to deciding the ideal gold percentage people should hold in their asset portfolios. The reason they differ has a lot to do with the way people perceive gold. Some view it as any other investment and use it accordingly. The try to generate a return by buying gold for a specific price only to sell it for a higher one. Some would argue that trading currency for gold in the hopes of one-day trading it for more currency defeats the very purpose of gold ownership.\nOwning gold and saving in it should act as an insurance policy against potential failure of currency. Instead of viewing it as an investment and means to an end, gold should be thought of as a type of savings and a long-term preservation of wealth. A currency might lose all its value, but gold will never be worthless.\nGold has been used as a basis of value and a focal point of saving wealth for thousands of years. Aristocrats in Europe, oil barons in the Middle East and the ultra-rich families from around the world have preserved their generational wealth by saving in gold. They don’t bother themselves with making a return on their investment because they use gold as a long-term carrier of value that can’t be printed and controlled by central banks like any ordinary currency.\nAs currencies continue to fluctuate, gold represents a safe-haven against a system-wide monetary collapse and in case it actually happens, having your wealth stored in gold is an excellent survival strategy. Since it’s denominated in traditional currency, the price of gold might vary, but its value will hold over time regardless of the current and future economic state.\nThe act of preserving wealth through gold is important in economic environments where investors have to deal with a declining currency and a rising inflation, due to increasing commodity prices. Throughout history, gold has been used as a hedge for safeguarding against either of these situations. Every time investors have realized that their paper currency is starting to lose its value, they have positioned their investments in hard assets such as gold, which has maintained its overall value.\nToday, the global price of gold is tied to the U.S. dollar and as it declines, gold keeps gaining value. There are two reasons behind this. Fist, those who buy gold, such as centrals banks and private investors, need to sell their dollars in order to make the transaction. This drives the dollar down because global investors now have to diversify into other currencies. Second, as the dollar weakens, gold becomes cheaper for those holding other types of currencies, resulting in an increased value of gold due to the demand for transactions using said currencies instead of the dollar.\nThere’s a couple of different ways you can invest in gold. Two of the most popular choices for those who are hesitant about investing in physical gold are ETFs or gold exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. Mutual funds hold more than one portfolio of gold stocks of companies that mine gold. These are often established mines capable of producing a specific amount of gold per year. ETFs represent a type of mutual fund that is traded on stock exchanges like a traditional stock. Lastly, there’s physical ownership of gold in the form of gold bullion or gold coins. Physically owning gold is ideal for saving it and but it offers very little benefits when it comes to turning a profit.\nAdding gold to your investment portfolio is a long-term, risk-reducing form of saving wealth regardless of the different portfolio classes, investor backgrounds or paper currencies and their fluctuating values. Using it to generate a larger profit is simply a bad business move and can easily result in you losing your entire wealth. Investing in various stock might be a better option when it comes to making a return on your investment and a far safer one for that matter. For accumulating and preserving generational wealth, however, gold was, is and certainly will be a standard."

        "text": "A skin fade (or bald fade) is a modern hairstyle achieved by cutting the hair lower and lower as you move with the clipper towards the neck.\nWith classic shaved sides all around and a long top, the bald fade haircut is low-maintenance and easy to achieve. Just ask your local barber.\nThe incredible contrast between the top and faded sides makes the men’s skin or bald fade one of our favorite cuts.\nA subtle take on the traditional skin fade style, a low bald fade starts increasing in length just above the ear.\nIt gradually grows longer until it is blended in with the hair on top of the head. The result is an understated yet stylish look that’s perfect for men trying the bald fade for the first time.\nMore noticeable than a low fade, the medium bald fade is less striking than a high fade yet the cut sits perfectly in between.\nYou typically begin about an inch above the ear and it looks particularly stylish when paired with voluminous style up top, such as a quiff or pompadour.\nIf you're looking for a high-contrast haircut that will take your style to the next level, ask for a high bald fade on your next visit to the barber.\nThis cool cut features a skin-shave up around two inches above the ears. From there, the cut quickly yet smoothly transitions into the hair on top of the head.\nIf you love the look of a mohawk but want something slightly more subtle, ask your barber for a bald fade faux hawk.\nThis impressive hairstyle features a skin fade on the sides and back partnered with a long top styled into a central point from the forehead to the crown.\nFor men with thick, textured hair, a bald fade can make a fantastic choice.\nWhether low, medium or high, a bald fade will infuse your Afro with a sleek sense of polish and style while still allowing you to showcase your natural texture.\nOne of the great things about a bald fade is that it allows you to maintain a neat and polished appearance while providing the freedom to experiment with different styles on top.\nFor example, pairing a skin fade with a quiff can create a fashion-forward look that’s still acceptable for the office.\nYou’ll look seriously sleek if you decide to try (and successfully pull off) a slicked-back bald fade hairstyle.\nThis cut is perfect for men who like a polished yet daring appearance. Just remember to go easy on the hair product to maintain some natural movement and keep the look modern.\nFor a bald fade with a strong personality, consider adding a shaved design to your look.\nTo do this, simply ask your barber to cut your hair into a standard skin fade. Then, have them shave a shape or design of your liking into one side.\nWhen you pair a blowout with a bald fade, you can create a surprisingly stylish and striking look. To make sure you nail this hairstyle, ask your barber to cut your hair into a skin fade with at least an inch left up top.\nNext, style by using a blow-dryer and a brush or comb to pull your hair upwards as it dries. Finally, use a high-quality styling product, such as pomade and hairspray to hold the look in place.\nWe recommend ShapeShifter by Mack for Men for a firm, yet flexible hold.\nAlthough this look can be tricky to style, the combination of a skin fade with a beard can look fantastic when done right.\nThe trick here is to taper your beard, starting very short near your ears before gradually growing into a longer length at your chin.\nDoing this will achieve a subtle contrast between your beard and fade and is a great way to add some edge to a bald fade hairstyle.\nA fade shaved right down to the skin is obviously a very stylish look. But it can also be a little too bold for some men.\nIf you fall into this category, consider softening the appearance of your skin fade by pairing it with a textured crop on top. The extra texture will perfectly balance the smooth appearance of your fade.\nIf you’re looking for a hairstyle that’s smart, sharp and requires zero daily styling, you can’t pass up the bald fade buzz cut.\nBy combining a skin fade and a buzz cut together, this minimal cut appears cool and contemporary. Just remember to book your barber for regular trims to keep your cut neat and precise.\nThe pompadour has been a top hairstyle among men for several years now. Although it’s not going away anytime soon, there’s no harm in giving this hairstyle a fresh update.\nTry asking your barber for a bald fade on the sides and back. The combination will leave you with a sleek and seriously on-trend appearance that's sure to stand out from the rest.\nAdd a touch of military style to your look by combining a skin fade haircut with an impressive side part style.\nYou notice this top cut boasts both precision and polish and offers men a bold look that can suit any occasion.\nFor a full bald fade that starts with absolutely no hair, ask your barber for a razor fade.\nUnlike a standard skin fade, which only uses clippers, this version requires the use of a straight razor to taper the hair down to the scalp.\nSimilar to a traditional military haircut, a military bald cut fade features hair shaved very short on top that is paired with a skin fade on the sides and back.\nThis low-maintenance hairstyle is perfect for achieving a minimal and masculine appearance.\nThe bald drop fade combines two fade cuts into one. This hairstyle, which reduces down to the skin with a drop fade, slopes downwards as it moves behind the ears to the back of the head.\nThe result is a clearly a fashionable version of the bald fade that can pair well with a variety of styles up top, making it an ideal hairstyle for men.\nUnlike other skin fade hairstyles, a bald taper fade does not rely solely on clippers to achieve its stylish appearance.\nInstead, this cut requires the use of scissors to smoothly transition from no hair around the ears to longer hair on top. It can be high, medium or low, and works well for men who prefer to maintain a decent length up high.\nGet your temples clean to the skin between a beard and the top hair for a sharp and neat vibe.\nThis bald fade hairstyle is the perfect choice for men wanting to pair a bald fade and a beard, but what a more subtle appearance they can rock every day.\nIf your a man searching for a dapper look, this bald fade is a great choice, offering you cleaned up sides to level up your hair game. On top of that, it suits almost all hair types.\nTo achieve a subtle yet classy look, try opting for a side-parted bald fade. This hairstyle is ideal for a business or professional setting, but can easily be dressed down for a casual, everyday look as well.\nMost bald fade haircuts are used to create dimension. With this one in particular, the sharp angles and precise curvy lines pair well with a Caesar cut.\nThis hairstyle is clearly for those looking to set the trends instead of following them.\nIf you have naturally wavy hair, this is the best bald fade hairstyle for you. The great thing about this look is you can shape it into practically anything you want and make it work for any occasion.\nIt might look rough and rugged to some, but with the right amount of hair wax, you can create beautiful waves and encourage the flow of your natural waves.\nIf you're a fan of the bald fade paired with a beard, you should definitely try pairing it with a disconnected hairstyle.\nWith this bald fade, your hairline and the beard line are discontinued by the fact that you have a shaved portion of your hair in the middle.\nIf you're considering adding a hard part, it could easily add some extra edge. It all comes down to taste.\nIf you have naturally curly hair, you're aware it can be both a gift and a curse. It’s definitely what we would call a beautiful head of hair, but those born with such a delight will often tell you how difficult it is to maintain. A bald fade might take some of the pressure off.\nYou can even sport a fauxhawk with a bald fade if you have curly hair. You get to decide its length and volume, giving it that personal touch.\nEven though the middle section between the hairline and the beard line is a bald patch, that doesn’t mean it has to be boring or simple in any way.\nIf you're looking for a hairstyle you can personalize and make your own, you can keep things interesting by adding designs, such as this classy V shape at the back of the head.\nA skilled barber will only take a few minutes to get you this look, as long as you have the right hair.\nIt will require leaving some thick and textured locks at the top that you should style with an upsweep and give the sides a razor fade with some elaborate patterns.\nYou can still have a blended look with a bald fade as you only need your barber to know and understand how to transition from the longer top to the skin level as gradually as possible.\nIf you're also a fan of buzzed hairstyles, try adding one to the crown with a fancy razor line to add some extra edge and style.\nNot only does a skin fade look great with pompadours, quiffs, and slicked back styles, but it also appears awesome when paired with an on-trend man bun.\nThis hairstyle, which is perfect for men with long, natural locks who want to try a new look, can be made even more unique with the addition of the double bun.\nThe flat-top hairstyle is another trend among men that keeps the top part of the hair flat while the rest is merged with the skin to create a seamless combination.\nAs you'll notice with this example, a cleanly trimmed beard compliments the look quite well.\nThis hairstyle is proof that the burst fade works with all types of hair, including thick, straight hair.\nIf you have naturally straight hair, this look offers the perfect contrast with the addition of a burst to the otherwise (boring) bald fade.\nFollowing the short sides, long top hair trend for men, this bald fade is no exception when it comes to a sleek and modern look."

        "text": "Should We Choose A Separate Spring Mattress?\nThe independent Spring Mattress is an extension of the original spring mattress. It is specially built according to the new requirements of the sleeping mattress. What is “independent”? The springs are made into an independent and interlocking arrangement. Together, they form a bed net. Its function is to make each independent spring work equally well. It can support the operation independently and can be stretched and contracted. It is called an independent spring mattress.\nAdvantage 1: The inner spring of the independent spring mattress can be independently operated to support the force, and the zero-tone mode is turned on. The whole night will not interfere with the sleeping companion, ensuring comfortable comfort and sleep, which can effectively promote deep sleep and improve sleep quality.\nAdvantage 2: The independent spring mattresses are all made of high-quality spring steel wire winding around the city \"independent barrel shape\". They are sealed in the fiber bag after compression process, which can effectively avoid the noise caused by mold, insects and springs.\nAdvantage 3: Adapted to the human body fit curve flexible and flexible, can protect the ridges, let the spine maintain a natural straight posture, let the body muscles fully relax, relieve the human body pressure, reduce the number of turns in sleep, create a good sleeping environment.\nDisadvantage 1: The independent spring mattress needs to be flipped regularly. In order to ensure the balance of the force of each part of the mattress, the elasticity is good and the durability is durable. This is also its shortcoming. It requires manpower for long-term maintenance and brings unnecessary trouble to life. It is one of the reasons why modern young people are not keen on independent spring mattresses.\nDisadvantage 2: Independent spring mattresses need to be cleaned regularly to avoid moisture and moisture, so as not to damage the mattress. Long-term humidity may affect the life and performance of the spring. This is also a place where the individual pocket springs are insufficient."

        "text": "This is a tutorial on how to solve any Rubik's-style mechanical twisting puzzle. It's also one of the shortest puzzle tutorials you'll ever read.\nThis is called a Teraminx.\nBut the name doesn't matter too much. It's a giant extension of the Megaminx.\nIf you're following along, pick up a puzzle at home. It could be a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. It could be an 11x11x11 Rubik's Cube. Or perhaps a Pyraminx. Any solved mechanical twisty puzzle will do.\nGood? Okay, now undo them in the opposite order.\nNow we are left with a puzzle that is still mostly solved, but has a small handful of pieces that have been shuffled around in various locations. We are only interested in one of these locations. And that is the one piece that occurs at the intersection of the two moves you chose. In the picture, it's the light blue piece on the yellow face. It's also important to note that this piece occurs on a row of pieces by itself separate from the other pieces that were affected.\nNow, imagine for a moment, how would you solve the puzzle from its current state? The answer is obvious. Do all the moves you just did, but backwards. It'll take you back to the starting point. The six or so pieces that are now wrong will return to the positions where they are correct.\nMore specifically, by doing the moves you just did backwards, the locations of the wrong pieces will be swapped around to the other locations.\nWhat if you were to turn the yellow face once before you undid your moves?\nLet's call the light blue piece that is now on the yellow face \"piece A\". Let's call the yellow piece that is on the light blue face \"piece B\". Let's call the yellow piece that used to reside where piece A is currently positioned \"piece C\" (note that piece B and C are not the same yellow piece).\nSo when you started out, piece A was on the blue face and pieces B and C were on the yellow face. Doing those 4 moves swapped A and B and undoing them would have swapped them back (along with a bunch of other pieces). However, when you made the 1 move before undoing your 4 moves, piece C was moved into the place of piece A. Undoing the 4 moves swapped C and B.\nThis is a three piece shuffle. Because B and C are both yellow, it looks like a 2-piece shuffle, but it really is a 3 piece shuffle.\nThis reasoning will apply to any puzzle.\nIf you know how to pick any random 3 pieces on a puzzle and swap them around, you can solve the puzzle. Slowly. But you can solve it, nonetheless. It takes some practice to be able to take control of which 3 pieces are affected by which two-move patterns, but it's not too difficult. You only have to think two moves ahead.\nAnd to re-iterate: this reasoning applies to every type of piece on every puzzle. It will work on the inner pieces of a 5x5x5 Rubik's Cube the same way it'll apply to the corners of a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube or the edges of a Megaminx.\nGet notified about new posts and snarky comments by following the twitter account."

        "text": "The reason, they believe, may be because during that time, millions of women abandoned [synthetic pharmaceutical] hormone treatment for the symptoms of menopause after a large national study concluded that the [synthetic] hormones slightly increased breast cancer risk.\n“Epidemiology can never prove causality,” said Dr. Peter Ravdin, a medical oncologist at the M.D. Anderson center and one of the authors of the analysis.\na lower risk of others, than those taking a placebo.\n“This could well be the study of the year in cancer,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, director of the Georgia Cancer Center at Emory University. He added that it also might help explain why breast cancer rates were lower for black women than for white women — blacks, he said, were less likely to use [prescription] hormones for menopause.\nOther researchers, who saw Dr. Berry’s analysis in advance of its presentation yesterday, said they found the hypothesis convincing.\nBecause the pills were known to slow bone loss, some women used them to prevent osteoporosis. Some women and doctors also believed, without any good evidence, that the pills could keep skin youthful, preserve memory and make women energetic.\nThe use of estrogen to treat menopause took off in 1966, when a doctor, Robert Wilson, wrote the best-selling book “Feminine Forever” and flew across the country promoting it. He insisted that estrogen could keep women young, healthy and attractive. Women would be replacing a hormone they had lost at menopause just as diabetics replace the insulin their pancreas fails to make.\n“We looked at all the possible explanations,” Dr. Berry said. He ticked them off: less mammography screening. But there was no sign of that. Increased use of drugs like tamoxifen that can prevent breast cancer; no evidence of that.\n“There was some notion that it might be statins, but that was essentially debunked,” Dr. Berry said.\nAfter July 2002, Dr. Berry said, the rate “dropped each month and it is exactly where you would expect it to be” if the declining use of menopausal hormones were the reason.\nThat was also the conclusion of Christina Clarke, an epidemiologist at the Northern California Cancer Center, and her colleagues, when they analyzed the cancers rates in California. The investigators used data they had collected for a National Cancer Institute’s program and data from Kaiser Permanente, the health insurer.\nThe investigators found that the breast cancer incidence fell even more in California than in the rest of the country — the overall drop was 11 percent in 2003, compared with 7 percent nationally. And, Dr. Clarke said, more women in California also had been using hormone therapy than women in other states.\nThere are undisputed differences between bio-identical natural progesterone and synthetic 'Progestin' as used in 'The Pill', Prempro and Provera.\nNOT natural progesterone from Wild Yam and Soya.\nSynthetic progesterone i.e.‘Progestin’ is the chemical HRT drug responsible for increased breast cancer, heart disease, strokes, blood clots and coronary embolisms.\nNatural Progesterone is a beneficial, safe, effective menopausal alternative.\nBy knowing the difference you can make an informed intelligent choice."

        "text": "At the very heart of Berlin, in the northern part of the Spreeinsel island on the Spree river, you will find one of the main attractions of the German capital city—a constellation of Berlin's museums, which has been known since the 19th century as the Museum Island. The idea of creating a public museum to exhibit works of European art from the ancient period to modern times was endorsed by the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm II at the end of the 18th century and implemented during the reign of his descendants. A hundred years later, the Spree's waters reflect the magnificent facades of five museums, each of which has a unique collection of exhibits relating to a particular artistic genre and historical/cultural epoch.\nLeft: Zhao Zhao’s work “Waterfall” (2013) was part of the Humboldt-Lab project \"Game of Thrones\", which dealt with experimental artistic forms for presenting an imperial Chinese throne from the collection of the Museum of Asian Art. Photo: Jens Ziehe, Courtesy Alexander Ochs Galleries Berlin / Beijing.\nRight: Simulation of the Museum Island with the Berlin Palace, the future home of the Humboldt-Forum, in the foreground (currently under construction).\n© SPK/ART+COM / Schloss: eldaco, 2015.\nCenter: Eight-headed dancing Hevajra, Cambodia, 12th or 13th century.\nThe museum complex was intended from the very beginning to become “an open space for the arts and sciences,” which is why Berlin became known as “Athens on the Spree.” During World War II, “the German acropolis” suffered massive destruction due to bombing, and the GDR government did not have enough funds to finish the costly restoration works. However, it was possible to modernize and restore most of the buildings, except the so-called New Museum, which was in ruins for over 70 years, and Berliners began to call it the “disgrace” of the city.\nA new life of the Museum Island began only in the late 1990s after the reunification of Germany. This life meant the realization of the so-called ‘Master Plan Museum Island,’ designed by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It involves the complete overhaul of all buildings and the first-time restoration of the New Museum as well as the addition of new buildings to combine them all into a single architectural ensemble. The scale of the transformations is amazing: the New Museum has been completely restored and now exhibits the unique Egyptian collection, including the famous bust of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the Pergamon Museum will receive a new wing; and the James Simon Gallery (currently under construction) will have everything necessary for a modern museum complex visited by several million people a year. The finale in the transformation of the Museum Island will be the restoration of the aboveground galleries of the Archaeological Promenade, an architectural “bridge” that will not only geographically connect four of the five museums in the island but also serve as a link between the cultural epochs and peoples reflected by the museums. The Archaeological Promenade will address multi-focus topics that have occupied the human mind independently of time and cultural region, be it the question of life after death or issues of beauty and other topics.\nBuilding the Archaeological Promenade is an important step towards creating a benchmark model of a modern museum—a universal encyclopedic-type museum tracing its origin to the “chambers of curiosities” (Kunstkameras), which created an “integral image of the Universe in a limited space.” According to the master plan designed by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, the next step will be to restore the Berlin Palace, which was blasted by the communist regime in GDR. Equipped with the latest museum technology, the rebuilt palace will be the future home of the Humboldt Forum, which will mainly be furnished by the non-European collections of the Berlin National Museums of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. African masks, boats from Oceania, and Chinese imperial throne—all of these items from the vast collections now stored in different museums of Berlin will guide museum visitors in their virtual tour around the world.\nPresently, the implementation of the master plan is far from complete; however, when the revived Berlin Palace opens its doors to visitors in 2019, one of the most ambitious humanitarian projects of the century to create a center of world art and culture will become a reality and a separate “museum Universe” will expand to the limits of the oecumene, the world inhabited by man."

        "text": "Blood biomarkers are measureable characteristics that reflect a particular physiologic state and in sports, have been used to assess an athlete’s overall health or determine positive/negative adaptations to training/environmental stimuli. The present study aimed to describe the changes in blood biomarkers in collegiate football (FB) (n=31) and cross country (XC) (n=29; 16 female, 13 male) athletes across a competitive season. These athletes were training and living at a moderate altitude (1655 m). The study used a database of previously collected blood biomarkers, that were regularly used to monitor athlete’s health and performance. All three groups (FB, MXC, FXC) had significant changes (p<0.05, tested by a linear mixed model) in both hematological biomarkers and muscle damage biomarkers. Although significant changes were observed, the means of the hematological blood biomarkers stayed within the normal reference ranges, and from a variance components analysis we observed that most of the variability was due to individual variability. Female XC had the most out of range hematology values (14%), which may be indicative of differences in hematological maintenance or pathology. Overall the hematological analyses suggest no significant decrements to oxygen carrying capacity across the season for FB, MXC, or FXC. Muscle damage biomarkers however, had means that were above the normal reference ranges, and the variance was mostly attributed to changes over time, rather than individual variability. These results could be high levels of muscle damage as a pathology in these athletes, or may indicate a need to consider new reference ranges for this population. This study provides evidence that both XC and FB athletes have changes in hematological and muscle damage markers across the season, of which may be due to effects of training, adaptations to moderate altitude, or nutrition. Further studies should assess these underlying mechanisms that cause the longitudinal changes in markers of hematology and muscle damage.\nMorris, Kalee Lucy, \"Changes in Blood Biomarkers Across a Competitive Season in Collegiate Athletes Residing at a Moderate Altitude: a Retrospective Analysis\" (2017).

Bush; Enron and the first Dotcom bubble were fostered under Clinton; the real estate bubble, Halliburton, the banking collapse, and Madoff’s heyday flourished during George W. Bush’s terms. President Obama is the first to assume the office in a state of near-total economic collapse on all fronts since FDR.\nShould a more qualified candidate appear, I have little doubt my vote would go to him or her but in the meantime appeals to xenophobia, distrust of womanhood, and catering to ideas of self-centeredness instead of community leave me unimpressed.\nI think our vote should be determined not by what we perceive as our similarity to a candidate but rather by whether or not the candidate’s plans will benefit more or fewer people. In the current campaign, the answer is clear enough to me: Obama has a broader, more inclusive, more informed, more decisive, more engaged team and strategy than his opponent. So I will vote for him even though he also represents interests and policies I might not favor.\nAdditionally, it might be worth having a look here to see what has, as a matter of record, been accomplished in the course of President Obama’s first term.\nThe matter of influence is a varied and frequently complex one, not least because of its relationship to authenticity, which I address here. I think it’s worth reiterating that I believe being truthful to one’s influences is as much a moral matter as it is a practical one, if not more so.\nSo we all, one way or another, actively seek influences. I take it as a measure of maturity, however, that one eventually assimilates them into an existing style and builds from there. That is, however much imitative modes might satisfy many performers, I think stopping at the sum of one’s influences is short-sighted."

        "text": "– Richard Kerr. What Happened to Global Warming? Scientists Say Just Wait a Bit.” Science, October 1, 2009.\nDebates over the ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ of global warming since its El Nino-driven peak back in 1998 should not forget the false confidence of leading alarmist scientists were saying less than a decade ago about how the warming slowdown was surely coming to an end. After all, model-predicted warming was the best indication of reality if the models had the right physics in them (a Big if).\nKerr framed the debate in political terms with Copenhagen just ahead—and failed to interview or include the low-sensitivity scientists who would have been closer to the mark.\nThe blogosphere has been having a field day with global warming’s apparent decade-long stagnation. Negotiators are working toward an international global warming agreement to be signed in Copenhagen in December, yet there hasn’t been any warming for a decade. What’s the point, bloggers ask?\nClimate researchers are beginning to answer back in their preferred venue, the peer-reviewed literature. The pause in warming is real enough, but it’s just temporary, they argue from their analyses.\nA natural swing in climate to the cool side has been holding greenhouse warming back, and such swings don’t last forever. “In the end, global warming will prevail,” says climate scientist Gavin Schmidt of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City.\nThe latest response from the climate community comes in State of the Climate in 2008, a special supplement to the current (August) issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Climate researcher Jeff Knight and eight colleagues at the Met Office Hadley Centre in Exeter, U.K., first establish that—at least in one leading temperature record—greenhouse warming has been stopped in its tracks for the past 10 years.\nIn the HadCRUT3 temperature record, the world warmed by 0.07°C±0.07°C from 1999 through 2008, not the 0.20°C expected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Corrected for the natural temperature effects of El Niño and its sister climate event La Niña, the decade’s trend is a perfectly flat 0.00°C.\nSo contrarian bloggers are right: There’s been no increase in greenhouse warming lately. That result came as no surprise to Knight and his colleagues or, for that matter, to most climate scientists. But the Hadley Centre group took the next step, using climate modeling to try to quantify how unusual a 10-year warming pause might be.\nIn 10 modeling runs of 21st century climate totaling 700 years worth of simulation, long-term warming proceeded about as expected: 2.0°C by the end of the century. But along the way in the 700 years of simulation, about 17 separate 10-year intervals had temperature trends resembling that of the past decade—that is, more or less flat.\nFrom this result, the group concludes that the model can reproduce natural jostlings of the climate system—perhaps a shift in heat-carrying ocean currents—that can cool the world and hold off greenhouse warming for a decade. But natural climate variability in the model has its limits. Pauses as long as 15 years are rare in the simulations, and “we expect that [real-world] warming will resume in the next few years,” the Hadley Centre group writes.\nAnd that resumption could come as a bit of a jolt, says Adam Scaife of the group, as the temperature catches up with the greenhouse gases added during the pause.\nPinning the pause on natural variability makes sense to most researchers. “That goes without saying,” writes climate researcher Stefan Rahmstorf of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany by e-mail. “We’ve made [that point] several times on RealClimate,” a blog.\nSolar physicist Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and climate modeler David Rind of GISS reached the same conclusion in a peer-reviewed 15 August paper in Geophysical Research Letters. They broke down recent temperature variation into components attributable to greenhouse gases, pollutant aerosols, volcanic aerosols, El Niño/La Niña, and solar variability.\nCombined, those influences explain all of the observed variability, by Lean and Rind’s accounting. But unlike the Hadley Centre’s model-based analysis, this assessment attributes a good deal of climate variability to variability in solar activity. That’s because most models can’t translate solar variability into climate variability the way the actual climate system can (Science, 28 August, p. 1058), Rind says.\nResearchers may differ about exactly what’s behind recent natural climate variability, but they agree that no sort of natural variability can hold off greenhouse warming much longer. “Our prediction is that if past is prologue, the solar component will turn around and lead to rapid warming in the next 5 years,” says Rind.\nClimate modeler David Smith of the Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the State of the Climate analysis, says his group’s climate model forecasts—made much the way weather forecasts are made—are still calling for warming to resume in the next few years as ocean influences reverse (Science, 10 August 2007, p. 746). Whether that’s in time to boost climate negotiations is anyone’s guess.\nPerhaps a new Science article can be headlined: “What Happened to Global Warming: Can Mainstream Climate Science Regain Its Footing?” Or maybe the strong El Nino this year will be proclaimed the ‘new normal’ with climate models telling us it should be so.\nBecause of CO2 warming built into model parameters, they can not reproduce or project any cooling periods, only warming or flat.\nLots of us are bored to death about global warming, the latest doomsday scenario. Before that there was global cooling which was going to cause massive crop failure and starvation. We remember the ozone hole which would end all life on earth. Before the ozone hole there was acid rain, and before that alar, PCBs, pesticides, and so on. All apocalyptic disasters that failed to materialize and magically disappeared. The environmentalists have a very high false alarm rate, like the little boy that cried wolf."

When you put everything you have into day one, it's usually day two that suffers. But day three, man, we all have high hopes for you, day three!\nThe girls made playdough people using playdough, sequins, beads, buttons, googly eyes and pipe cleaners - just like these helpful people did. We love helpful blogs, written by mommies, who have already done all the work. My hat is off to you, Picklebums, and not only because, well, pickle bums. That's just funny stuff.\nI forgot to mention yesterday, but we started following a list I pinned ages ago called Lego Quest. Each day, another Lego challenge is extended. Yesterday's was to build an eight seater van. And the boy was successful.\nToday's challenge was to build something monochromatic. Once we learned the definition of monochromatic (vocabulary! I would so win at this pretend homeschooling thing), he built this very cool orange helicopter. And the little girl next to him, his faithful sidekick, built a little red bed that she tried to shove inside the orange helicopter. Some pushing and shoving ensued, until I offered to take their picture. All of a sudden, we're all smiling.\nAnd then, at one point this morning, we swung by the drive thru at the bank and we discovered that our very own TDBank is offering to deposit $10 in any child's savings account, should said child read ten books by August 31st.\nAugust 31st? Ha! All I can say is, challenge accepted, TDBank, because one of my kids sat and read five books today, with plans to read the other five tomorrow and a trip to collect his paycheck on Thursday. Besides eating, reading is pretty much all he did today. Granted, these aren't long books but as he pointed out, it doesn't specify, Mommy. So there you go.\nI did have to gently break it to him that the bank does cap you at ten books. He kind of thought that he would receive ten dollars every time he read ten books. He was sad and happy at the same time, because ten dollars is still ten dollars. He does get extra points for asking if he could maybe read another ten books and go to a different bank branch, but sadly, those points don't come in dollar form because trying to pull one over on the bank is bad form. Very bad form, actually, but who's keeping score?\nMoving along, a high point of my day was when the 9-year-old disappeared into his room with tape, scissors and paper, and emerged and 90 minutes later, as, apparently, a bar mitzvah boy.\nHe made his own tefillin. For fun. He's just so cute, I can't. His tefillin bag - complete with his name spelled in Hebrew - that he made from a torn pillow case is currently drying underneath his enormously heavy Lego book, but shall be on display tomorrow for all to see.\nOne would almost think that nothing could top my love for a creative 9 year old, but I have to tell you, today's moment-of-the-day was about me. I did not, like yesterday, learn a new song on the piano. No, it's even better, if you can believe it. Today (today!), I taught my boys math. Me. Math. I am the girl who scored a 68, a 67, and then a very passable 66 on her math regents in 9th, 10th and 11th grades.\nI know, my father was very proud too.\nBut this afternoon, I successfully explained how to multiply four digit numbers by two digit numbers. And I know I was right because I checked my work, and also because the worksheet came with an answer key, but that is so neither here nor there.\nTomorrow, we move on to multiplying four digit number by three digit numbers. Hold on to your pants, it's about to get crazy here.\ni don't like the fact that u said aunt jessica. thank u for talking about my tefilin. \"and emerged 90 minutes later like a bar mitzvah boy\" loved it. also, this blog just make me laugh."

        "text": "This morning I was looking for some old images of my mother to share with my Dad. In the process I found a group shot of all of us together last Thanksgiving. Good friends, Bob and Holly Coates were in Sarasota on vacation then and joined us.\nThe image is just a self-timer group shot. It'll never win an award for group portraiture, but it would win an award for all the great memories it brings back.\nOkay, so there's a segue here that might be hard to follow, but that's what Sundays are all about. This image got me thinking about great images and in turn education and it got me thinking about what Bob is doing in photography now.\nOur home is like a gallery, filled with prints that span my entire career, including one of Bob's. Bob has always worked hard to stay cutting edge, but part of the process is experimenting with new techniques. Like all great photographers he recognizes the importance of a never-ending focus on his own education. He also believes in personal projects to help keep his passion for the craft alive and well, no matter what he's shooting day in day out for his business.\nI've written so much about the importance of personal projects, never compromising on quality, listening to your heart and expanding your skill set. Bob's images this morning are just one example of a quality that's a common denominator with so many of the people we consider iconic in our industry...he never stops learning and pushing the edge of the creative envelope.\nI wanted to share some of his images with you in this post, first, because they're stunning and some of my favorites. Second, they take me to the topic of education and the fact that you can never stop learning.\nEven Ansel Adams had thoughts about his own work and how technology would change things. I'm paraphrasing a lot, but in '84 Ansel made a comment about \"wondering what people will be able to do with his negatives electronically in twenty years!\"\nSo, here's the real point this morning - as you look at your own portfolio are you producing images that are truly great? Can you look back at a year or two of your images and see your growth in the craft? Do your images represent a continuous expansion of your skill set? What will people say about your images years from now? Most important of all, every time you click the shutter are you keeping your dream alive?\nWow! I am humbled by the kind words about my work. Thanks Skip Cohen I believe the constant learning involved in staying ahead in the photography game is why I'm still a photographer. Need to be challenged and pushing the envelope fills the bill. Thanks again Skip!!"

But since I found out about my lactose intolerance, it’s a bit difficult to find all of these things without any lactose. Most of the cookies and cakes are made with butter of course, breaks my heart a little haha.\nBut! I went to VeggieWorld (a vegan food fair) and I came across the stand of ‘het zaanse bakkertje’. And it was a big one! I saw croissants, cookies, bread rolls, little cakes and even pizza. You understand I went crazy haha. No, just kidding of course. But I definitely didn’t know what to get.\nFirst I will tell you something about the bakery. 21 years ago they opened the bakery. And they were so popular, that within no time they had to move to a bigger building. They work with traditional recipes, but also listen to the needs of the customer. So since last year they also have vegan products. They started with 3 and now have 60 vegan products! Wow! On Friday and Saturday they’ve all the products in store, but you’ve to be quick. ‘Cause everyone wants them and they run out quick, but you can always order on their website; veganbakery.nl.\nI couldn’t take it all home of course, so I got 2 spelt croissants, 1 little cake with nuts (notentaartje) and 1 almond paste cookie (gevulde koek).\nSorry the spelt croissants didn’t even made the photo’s haha. I was so craving for croissants I ate them right away. And they were delicious. A little bit dryer than a normal croissant, but maybe that was because of the spelt. But they were flakey, as a croissant needs to be!\nThe little cake with nuts was delicious as well, it is a little round cake filled with almond paste and topped of with various nuts. And lots of sugar! It was a bit sweet, but didn’t taste any different than a ‘normal notentaartje’.\nAnd now about the ‘gevulde koek’; OMG this was DE-LI-CIOUS! It was just like a normal ‘gevulde koek’. Maybe I’m so enthusiastic about this one, because I always liked these cookies. And of course it was such a long time ago I ate one, but even my boyfriend said it was one of the best ‘gevulde koeken’ he ever ate!\nSo please, please go and get this. You’re gonna be happy you did!"

        "text": "Fans of JKT48 had their first taste of a reorganization at Saturday’s Pintu Masa Depan (Mirai no Tobira) concert, the closing act in a series of four back-to-back concerts that spanned a full day. While some fan circles have called for a reorganization for some months, others have considered such a move too early, given the recent formation of Team T.\nOn the other hand, there is greater consensus that some sort of refresher is necessary for JKT48 to overcome stagnation. A leadership shuffle, therefore, is one way management is able to bring about change without creating too much chaos. It also prepares fans for the future possibility that management makes more far-reaching changes in order to advance the group’s standing.\nManagement had presented a challenge for each of JKT48’s three teams. The first team to sell out all of its concert’s seats would gain the right to publish its own CD album, and the second team to do so would be able to release its own photo book. No team was able to fulfill this objective, despite Team J coming to within 100 tickets of a sold out concert. Therefore, JKT48 General Manager Jiro Inao indicated the possibility that management will present the same challenge again in the future.\nGiven the leadership shuffle announced on Saturday, it will be interesting to observe if and how the competition for these two rewards evolve.\nAs of the end of June, Melody will have held the position of JKT48 Captain for 18 months. In this time period, JKT48 has held two elections and welcomed its third and fourth generation members. Needless to say, with the rapidly changing line-up of JKT48, management saw the need for a stabilizing factor in the group. They saw this in Melody, who had started off simply as a center but saw her role evolve into something more as the group grew over the years.\nIn a move which can be seen as management’s further acknowledgment of Melody’s stabilizing presence, she will be appointed JKT48 Theater General Manager effective August 1, 2015. This is not the same position as General Manager, which remains occupied by Jiro Inao. However, since the departure of the JKT48’s other General Manager, Mifumi Kato, earlier this year, management may have seen the need to delegate some of the duties which currently rest entirely on Inao.\nAs mentioned by Inao, this position is new to JKT48 but already exists among its sister groups in Japan. Notable examples are Hiroshi Yuasa, the SKE48 Theater Manager and previously AKB48 Theater Manager, and Rino Sashihara, an HKT48 Theater Co-Manager. It is unclear how Melody’s new role will relate to Vikry Artha, who currently runs JKT48 Theater’s operations. However, Melody’s position opens a new door for the group—it now has the opportunity to further focus its efforts into theater performances.\nIn the midst of all the drama of elections and team rivalries, we often forget that JKT48 are first and foremost theater idols. Without its theater, JKT48 has no core activity. While attendance of theater performances has never been better, there has been a noticeable lack of enthusiasm among fans who frequently attend them. Addressing this issue should be the first priority of Melody’s new role.\nThe formation of Team T echoed the drama of the formation of Team KIII—not all third generation members were able to be promoted into the same team at the same time. Learning from past experience, fans have rallied to support the third generation members left behind as Trainees, and I feel these Trainees have risen to the occasion faster than the second generation. I have seen fans of these promoted Trainees come out in strong protest against management’s neglect, which may have had an impact on these promotions. It was also pointed out that these four members either sold out or nearly sold out their sessions at the Pareo is Your Emerald Handshake Festival.\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the breakup of the third generation into separate teams will permanently change its dynamic as what happened to the second generation.\nThe position of team captain is likely a better fit for Shania than center, a position she held in the seventh single “Papan Penanda Isi Hati”. It is common knowledge that Shania has often stepped up as a leader in Team J. Other first generation members have also acknowledged her potential as a future team captain because of her tendency to speak up her mind and bring the team together in the absence of senior members.\nWhat remains to be seen is if and how her leadership style will differ from Kinal’s. Team J remains the darling team of fans, but its position is threatened by the possibility of senior members graduating and younger members usurping their popularity. As the fourth youngest member in the team and the second youngest among the first generation, Shania is certain to bring fresh ideas to reinvigorate Team J, but she must also transition it from a legendary team into one that remains accessible to new fans.\nWhile a controversial move, Naomi’s sacking as captain will come as no surprise to some observers. Her team recently won back-to-back competitions in jump rope and battle of the brains against Team J. Although these victories boosted the team’s morale, they have no lasting effects. In the recent JKT48 Journal documentary, Naomi admitted that she had not expected the original captaincy announcement and is still learning how to lead. Team KIII has accomplished much in its first two years, yet its holistic progress remains lacking compared to Team J. Management may feel that the team cannot afford to lag behind any further.\nTeam KIII is often fragmented in its identity despite having a dedicated following and its share of frontline members. The impact of management’s decision to break up the second generation into separate teams in 2013 remains a difficult memory, as seen in the documentary. While second generation members in the original Team KIII had hoped that all of their cohorts would eventually be promoted into the same team, management denied the reunion by assigning Dena, Rachel, and Vanka to Team J. This abrupt change was difficult to swallow as members saw some of their cohorts be assigned into the “senior” team.\nNaomi will have completed two years as team captain come July, but Team KIII appears to have reached a glass ceiling. As new team captain, Kinal has two primary tasks. The first is to help the team discover and enhance its identity. When this task is achieved, the second is to help the team overcome its past and break the ceiling that is preventing them from competing on even ground with Team J. In the words of its concert theme, Team KIII must not look back into the past and let it hinder them from seeing the future.\nIn another controversial move, management decided to appoint a frontline Team J member as leader of a previously captainless team. This move can either jump start Team T’s competitive nature or backfire more seriously than the second generation’s breakup. Haruka’s appointment may mean that no clear individual has emerged as a candidate for captain of Team T. Fans are also divided on who among the third generation is fit for the role.\nThe only option is then to bring an outsider. Having worked with Grace and Angel in 4 Gulali, Haruka is the only member to have worked closely with members of Team T. If Haruka has shown that she has leadership potential, this is a gamble that management is willing to take. However, this puts additional pressure on Haruka, who confessed in her election speech that she has worried whether she is up to the task, having had little experience as a frontline member in AKB48. This move reflects AKB48’s own history when Kazumi Urano was reassigned from Team A to the newly formed Team B in December 2006, eventually acting as the team’s de facto leader before captains were appointed.\nThis is where the appointment can backfire, because appointing an outsider as team captain means Team T will not have an opportunity to identify itself as a third generation team the way Team KIII identified itself as a second generation team. Should this experiment fail, the team will have an even more difficult time in formulating a unified identity in the future and remain without a leader if Haruka is sacked.\nNaomi being stripped of her captaincy and reassigned to Team J may be a blow to her pride, but she and Elaine must see the reassignment in a positive light. It may be an indication that management is giving them an opportunity to learn from the veterans, meaning that they still have the potential to return as or be appointed captains of their original teams. This is also a test for Team J, which has never received another member who is not promoted from Trainee status. How will the team help to integrate these members into its inner circle?\nFor Elaine especially, it is my observation that she has stalled in her ability to emerge as a frontline member since the formation of Team T. While she remains popular among fans, having earned the under girls center position in the tenth single, the determination of the Elaine I saw in Team T is lacking compared to the one in the Red Trainee Team. It is my hope that she will regain her ambition as a member of Team J.\nI hope this is just a short term assignment (STA) for those four members (Naomi, Elaine, Kinal, and Haruka), because transfer them permanently will be really risky for JKT48 future. As far as I know, Japanese company usually put a lot of attention to risk management, they tend to keep the risk as low as possible eventhough it will not give good payback.\nBut, there always plan B for everything. If this leadership shuffling doesn’t work in the future, JOT could still reshuffle everyone in JKT48 and make three new and unique teams.\nffs, it’s almost 4 years and JKT48 theater still hasn’t got a hydraulic stage. Please make that happen. Even if it’s going to effect ticket pricing.\nI can’t help but to wonder. These whole “KIII has been lacking and/or lagging in this and that” assertion… What’s the basis? What are the parameters?\njust a small twist from jot, and they react like it’s apocalypse now..\nIt’s been almost 24 hours with no explanation whatsoever. I’m going to leave this as it is, an article based on nothing but (as you said earlier) assumptions & speculations.\nStill can’t reach J, yet already being chased by T. Did Kinal will bring any good for KIII?\nThe fact Naomi have lost the rank of Captain, can influence her performance in JKT48 of a negative way?\nI agree with your insights. I thought the team shuffle would be too early, but perhaps necessary. Then when it happened, I somehow began to think it is necessary.\nBut I don’t understand some of KIII fans. They made a big fuss over a minor change. All teams, and perhaps all members, suffered. What was their reason exactly? Was it because they think Kinal is worth less than Naomi? I can’t even imagine how they will react to major reshuffle in the coming future. Come to think of it, up until now all KIII members were all from 2nd generation. Maybe it’s time to spice things up a little bit more by assigning some of the trainees from 3rd or 4th gens as regular KIII members. We’ll see how the KIII members and their diehard fans will react to the changes.\nIt is interesting though, watching all the “presumably adult” fans get so worked up over teenagers-dancing-and-singing-in-uniforms. Their reactions and comments over what teenage girls said and done are sometimes too eye-rolling.\nI understand the supporters of KIII team. It is not easy swallowing a reformulation so.\nIt is even harder for the members affected by the reshuffle. But the fans are being super sensitive, and make it worse by saying/tweeting harsh comments toward particular team or member.\nSorry. I just can’t understand.\nno.. i disagree. Team K3 only lost their team captain. Getting Kinal cannot be considered a loss. If you read beby’s post in her G+. I strongly agree that team J is the one team who will suffered the most. Losing 2 of their prominent members will definitely make a huge impact. And getting more ‘outsiders’ in this case 3 of them (Naomi, Elaine, Sofia) cannot be considered easy. Team J will have to start with new captain, new members, which of course brings more change and dynamics compared to other teams who only got a ‘new’ captain.\nIn K3 I believe the most suffering person is Kinal, as a new captain, she’s the one who has to adapt.. not the team since K3 is already a solid team."

Today one of the doctors from our clinic came to give a health lesson. We discussed how to know the difference between a common cold in children and pneumonia. Pneumonia is the number one killer of children in Papua New Guinea. However, there is a tendency for many villagers to go to the clinic and ask for “sut marasin” (an antibiotic shot) for any kind of illness that they have. Today the students learned that antibiotics should not be used to treat common colds, and also what signs to look for to know when a child really does need to go to the clinic and get medication.\nWe also learned about tuberculosis and the dangers of smoking. TB is a leading killer of adults in PNG, and so we learned about how it is spread, what the symptoms are and how it can be treated. Smoking is also very common in PNG, and there are common misconceptions. For example, many people believe that only imported, packaged cigarettes will mess up your body, and that the roll-your-own variety have no health consequences.\nFinally, we spent some time talking about cholera. Just this year, Papua New Guinea experienced its first cholera outbreak. It started near a port city and is slowly making inroads to other parts of the country. The students were glad to learn that it is a preventable disease and what steps they could take to protect themselves and their communities."

Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) has provided additional guidance regarding the implementation of the U.S. sanctions.\nThe European Union enacted its first set of restrictive measures on March 2, 2011 through Council Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 (the EU Regulation). These measures include, among others, a ban on the sale, supply, transfer or export of equipment that might be used for internal repression; a ban on the financing of military technology; and a ban on the provision of technical assistance and brokering services related to equipment that might be used for internal repression.\nThe EU Regulation freezes the economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by members of the Qadhafi family and certain other natural and legal persons. The EU Regulation prohibits transactions that may directly or indirectly benefit these persons by preventing any funds or economic resources being made available to them and by barring any business dealings with these persons or any entities controlled by them.\nResolving a major uncertainty concerning the extent to which the EU measures would apply to Libyan state enterprises, on March 10, 2011, the EU expanded these restrictive measures through Council Regulation (EU) No 233/2011, which added one new individual and five new entities to the list of designated persons affected by the restrictions discussed above.\nAmong the most prominent entities targeted by the new EU restrictive measures is the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), the country’s well-known sovereign wealth fund that is a principal channel for Libya’s overseas investments.\nMr. Mustafa Zarti – An Austrian citizen who holds multiple executive positions in private and Libyan entities, including vice chief executive of the LIA; board member of the National Oil Corporation; head executive of Tamoil; and vice chairman of First Energy Bank in Bahrain.\nNotably, the National Oil Company of Libya (NOC) is not yet listed by the EU, although the latest list includes Mr. Zarti, a NOC board member.\nCanada: On Sunday, February 20, the Canadian government imposed sanctions that included a freeze on assets belonging to Colonel Qadhafi, his family, the Libyan government and certain financial institutions. The Canadian sanctions also restrict dealings with the Libyan government, its institutions and agencies, including the Libyan Central Bank.\nUnited Kingdom: On February 27, The United Kingdom adopted the Libya (Financial Sanctions) Order 2011 (S.I. 2011/548), which implements the requirements of the UN Resolution 1970 by imposing restrictions on the assets designated in Annex II to the UN Resolution, and entities owned or controlled by those designated persons. The Order requires that the funds, other financial assets and economic resources of Qadhafi and other designated persons, persons acting on their behalf or at their direction and entities owned or controlled by them be frozen. It also prohibits the provision of funds or other financial assets to a designated person or for his or her benefit, the provision of economic resources to or for the benefit of a designated person and the participation in activities that circumvent or facilitate the circumvention of provisions outlined in the Order.\nSwitzerland: Switzerland imposed sanctions (amended on March 3, 2011) targeting 29 Libyan individuals. The measures freeze the assets, property and resources that are under the control of those individuals and ban transfers of or the direct supply of cash or economic resources to those individuals either \"directly or indirectly.\"\nLibya General License No. 1, authorizing transactions with financial institutions owned by the government of Libya that are organized under the laws of a third country.\nLibya General License No. 2, which authorizes the provision of goods and services in the United States to the diplomatic missions of the Government of Libya to the United States and the United Nations, as well as payment for such goods and services, under certain conditions.\nLibya General License No. 3, which authorizes the provision of certain legal services to or on behalf of the Government of Libya, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities, provided that all receipts of payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses must be specifically licensed.\nIn addition, on March 11 and March 15, 2011, OFAC expanded the list of specifically targeted individuals to include additional individuals and institutions. While the U.S. and EU lists overlap, the scope of the sanctions differ in that the U.S. provisions broadly include the Government of Libya, its agencies, instrumentalities and other controlled entities (in addition to listing specific individuals and institutions), while the EU sanctions name only specific individuals and the four institutions listed above.\nOFAC has under consideration requests for specific licenses to address various circumstances involving transactions that were in process at the time sanctions were imposed, including, for example, shipments of Libyan crude oil or products that were already on the high seas and other transitional matters. It is possible that OFAC will issue more general licenses providing authorizations and guidance on issues of common concern."

One of the earliest forms of written expression is .\nThe history of writing traces the development of expressing language by letters or other marks and also the study and description of these developments.\nAs human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BCE, the complexity of trade and administration in outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. In both and , writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events. argued that writing has the ability to \"put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death\".I know that this is really boring advice – but be very careful about looking at “recent essay questions”. For me, their only real value is to tell you the types of topic you will need to write about and what sort of vocab you need. Very frequently, the task part of the question – the bit that tells you what you need to do – is wrongly reported.Those who claim that Irenaeus invented the four Gospels, or that they were first written during his time, have not explained how he could foist such a fiction on other members of the Catholic Church at such a late date, and hope to retain any credibility. It seems much more likely that there is some grain of truth in his claim that they had existed much earlier, and that his true purpose in writing about the Roman Gospels was to assert their claims of superiority over the many apocryphal “gospels” that were proliferating at the time. Some of these apocryphal gospels might have been earlier Roman drafts that had been superseded, and others might have been similar to modern “fan fiction”. However, all of them needed to be stamped out, as the Roman hierarchy had determined that the time had come to bring Christianity into a single large tent. As Irenaeus explained:An is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.\nThere is no very definite statement as to the material which was in most common use for the purposes of writing at the start of the early writing systems. In all ages it has been customary to engrave on stone or metal, or other durable material, with the view of securing the permanency of the record; and accordingly, in the very commencement of the national history of Israel, it is read of the two tables of the law written in stone, and of a subsequent writing of the law on stone. In the latter case there is this peculiarity, that plaster (, lime or gypsum) was used along with stone, a combination of materials which is illustrated by comparison of the practice of the Egyptian engravers, who, having first carefully smoothed the stone, filled up the faulty places with gypsum or cement, in order to obtain a perfectly uniform surface on which to execute their engravings. Metals, such as stamped , are mentioned as a material of writing; they include lead, brass, and gold. To the engraving of gems there is reference also, such as with seals or signets.\nWriting was invented independently a number of times. The , the , the and the writings are separate in their invention.p85 All these writing systems started with , symbols that stood for things. Then they developed a mixture of methods.

Which is the first major sell off I have seen in a while.\nWith the situation over at Greece, and from what I understand a few other potential European countries, a “dash of shorts spice” was thrown into the markets.\nOver the past few years, most short-term selloffs turned out to be a buying opportunity, but as they say hindsight is 20/20 vision.\nAs one who got burnt going short on the indices I am trying to be a bit more careful.\nIn order for the Russell to confirm a sell signal based on the weekly chart, I need to see a daily close below 1244. Yesterday was VERY close to it but still closed above it.\nI think that a close below 1244 can trigger 1089 over the next few weeks/months.\nNot an easy scenario to trade with as the memories of short attempts in the past few years not turning into much to say the least….\nOne way one can trade this is by using straight futures and going short on close below 1244. The risk on this one would be quite high as one would need to use a stop above 1280 or maybe even past the recent high above 1292.\nAnother way to go about it (and one can choose stock index of their choice) is to buy a vertical put spread, where you buy a closer to the money put and sell a further out of the money put.\nAs always, certain strategies may be more appropriate for certain traders, depending on their experience, market outlook and risk capital."

The reaction system (So, SoH+, SoH22+, Sc' ScH+, ScH22+) comprising three protolytic forms in both open and closed configuration, is characterized by four protolytic equilibrium constants and six photochemical quantum yields of ring closing and ring opening. The absorption spectra, conductivity, and effective photochemical quantum yields were measured in acetonitrile as functions of solvent acidity varied by addition of trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine and characterized by an effective pHnon-aq. Based on the derivation of a rigorous method for assessing the individual quantum yields of ring closure and ring opening of the six species, it was shown that it is specifically the second protonation step that is responsible for a more than 10-fold increase in the quantum yield of ring closure."

Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, an expert on the Middle East policy, explains why now is the time for supporters of peace and diplomacy to reassert what the deal the Obama administration struck with Iran has accomplished.\nAs a result of the deal, there have already been more conversations between the U.S. and Iran over other regional conflicts, which is tremendously significant. Now that this diplomatic channel is wider, the U.S. should hold up its end of the bargain and lift more of the economic sanctions against Iran, which can only be done by Congress, Gould says.\nOn this issue, it matters who is in the White House – Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said ripping up the Iran deal would be among his first actions if he is president – and it matters how much citizen pressure in support of continued diplomacy with Iran is felt by Congress."

Learn more.\nChapter 13 bankruptcy allows debtors to wipe out certain types of debt that are not dischargeable in a Chapter 7. This means that if you file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may be able to eliminate more of your debts than you can in a Chapter 7. Read on to learn more about the kinds of debts you can discharge in Chapter 13 bankruptcy but not in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nWhich Debts are Discharged in Bankruptcy?\nThe following are the most common types of debt a Chapter 13 discharge will eliminate but a Chapter 7 discharge will not.\nIf you willfully or maliciously damage another person’s property, you can’t discharge any debts that result from your actions in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. But you can discharge debts related to willful and malicious damage to property in Chapter 13 bankruptcy. However, keep in mind that you can’t eliminate any debts arising out of your willful or malicious acts that cause personal injury or death in Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nIf you incur a debt to pay off nondischargeable tax obligations (such as paying your tax liability with a credit card), you can discharge that debt in Chapter 13 bankruptcy but not in Chapter 7.\nIf you incur debts (other than domestic support obligations) to your spouse, former spouse, or child through a divorce decree, property settlement, separation agreement, or other related proceeding, you can discharge them only in Chapter 13 bankruptcy. These typically include debts assigned to you in the course of divorce or separation proceedings. But remember that domestic support obligations such as alimony or child support are not dischargeable in Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nExample: If a family court judge requires you to pay a joint credit card in your divorce decree, you have an obligation to your former spouse to pay off that debt. If you don’t pay off the card, the credit card company can sue your former spouse to collect the debt despite the divorce decree. If your spouse ends up paying the debt, he or she can come after you for reimbursement. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you can wipe out your personal liability to the credit card company for the joint debt – but not your obligation to your spouse under the divorce decree. But a Chapter 13 discharge wipes out your obligation to your spouse as well as to the credit card company.\nIf you filed for bankruptcy previously and the court denied your discharge, you can’t eliminate those same debts in a subsequent Chapter 7 case. However, you may be able to discharge the debts from your prior bankruptcy in Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nAny money you borrow from your retirement plan is essentially a debt you owe to yourself. These debts are dischargeable in Chapter 13 bankruptcy but not in Chapter 7. However, if you continue to make your loan payments during bankruptcy, you can reduce your disposable income and the amount you must pay unsecured creditors through your repayment plan. Because of this, as a practical matter, it is typically in your best interest to continue your retirement loan payments in Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nUnlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to discharge condominium or homeowners association (HOA) dues that are incurred after your filing date. But keep in mind that your HOA typically has a lien on your property for any outstanding fees despite your discharge. This means that if you want to keep your house, you should continue paying all of your HOA fees.\nChapter 7 bankruptcy doesn't eliminate most types of fines and penalties you owe to governmental entities. But fines and penalties payable to the government (other than criminal fines) are generally dischargeable in Chapter 13 bankruptcy."

        "text": "It was another great learning for me.\nI had a pleasant surprise experience regarding my tax matter today.\nEvery March 15th is the kakutei shinkoku, the final tax return deadline. In the middle of the busiest fiscal year end job rush, I managed to submit P/L, B/S, shiwake, i.e. journal and all the necessary reports, except for filling the gensen choushu zeigaku (withholding tax amount) and the bank account detail on the kakutei shinkoku sho, the final return.\nI realized about the fact when the kampukin, the tax refund had not been deposited to my specified bank account until today. I immediately checked the copies of my document submitted to the tax office and realized my omission.\nHowever, you may want to know that you can claim the kampukin tax refund for five years since the 1st January next year of your desired accounting year ending on the 31st December. Usually, kampukin should be deposited in my bank account latest by the end of April.\nIn this case, though, I have already submitted gensen choshu hyo, withholding skip, at the time of kakutei shinkoku. So I called the tax office and sought their advice on how to go about my kampukin.\nTheir answers and responses were surprising.\nFirstly, tax officers whoever attended my call were very polite, attentive, and kind. I hardly felt a slight annoyance in their tone when I asked their favor in letting me know the procedure to tackle \"the late claim of kampukin.\"\nSecondly, I only had to tell my surname to assist their search of my record (not even required of \"My Number\".) While my name \"Deshmukh (デシュムク)\" is unique at least in the eastern part of Fukuoka city and suburban, I don't know how they search the caller's file so quickly. Perhaps they detect the telephone number and match with the name?\nFinally, the person in charge of my tax report called me back within five minutes as promised, telling me he was planning to contact me for the same regards, informing me that I forgot to write necessary information of kampukin refund at the time of kakutei shinkoku. Moreover, he offered me that he would fill the possible kampukin amount already in a postcard or like official form(s) and send it to my residence address, so that what all I need to do would be simply write down my bank details to receive the refund and then place my stamps thereon. He even apologized me that the process is likely to take some time that even if I send back aforementioned necessary information immediately, it might be deposited maximum in July.\nI don't know what would be our destiny if the same happened in India!"

        "text": "I love the picture of this little guy on the front page of The Vancouver Sun. The sparkle in his eyes and the look on his face remind me so much of my son at that age. With life comes the opportunity for grand adventure! Joy is suppose to be part of every child’s life. I hope that all things good unfold for this little man. The title of the Vancouver Sun picture: “A New Age is At Hand”. Colonialism did not work for the Indigenous people of Canada. But there is hope and there is unprecedented optimism for the future.\nA fierce pride in Canada’s accomplishments throughout its almost, 151 years of nationhood, is strong. The is a realization that north of the 49th parallel existed for thousands of years prior to confederation. The learning from the Indigenous people was invaluable. Finally it is part of the national conversation. Within the field of Education in British Columbia, there is a quest to embrace our history, even when it includes the shame of colonial structures and prejudice that allowed children to be separated from their parents and basic human rights to be ignored.\nSummer solstice, the longest day of the year, was chosen to be THE day to celebrate, recognize and honour the heritage, cultures and valuable contributions by the First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples of Canada. The Northwest Territories has celebrated this day as a statutory holiday since 2001 and The Yukon followed suit in 2017. The day started with one of the teachers engaging me in a conversation of the use of “Indigenous” rather than “Aboriginal’ and the implications. I had my phone out, googling, so we could determine why Metro Vancouver Celebrations were mostly using the word “Aboriginal” and “Indigenous” was being used on the national stage. What was most respectful? How do we explain the difference? What I thought was indicative of this “new age” was that it mattered.\nOne of our Grade 3 teachers, Janet Logie, is a committed student of history and volunteer at the Hastings Mills Museum at the Old Mill Park by Jericho Beach. As a kid, my sister and my cousins, would regularly swing into the museum to check it out when we were at the park. It still smells the same but the context has changed. Amazingly intricate baskets and artifacts that were purchased as parts of private collections have been curated and recognized as significant parts of the history of Vancouver. Recently there was a special event to publicly thank the Indigenous First Responders during the Great Vancouver Fire of 1886 who saved many lives. Marissa Nahanee, of the Squamish Nation, performed the Paddle Song beside the replica of the historic “Tent City Hall” and volunteers served Indigenous herbal teas by Raven Hummingbird Teas in the museum. Our MP, Joyce Murray, brought formality, acknowledgment and thanks of the government. It was a great event. Our children are growing up with an appreciation of the contributions by the Indigenous community in our shared history when they go out to play.\nThe focus on the herbs grown and used by the Indigenous people has been a focus for Grade 2 teacher, Joan Phoenix. Our PAC (Parent Advisory Committee) supported her financially in designing and planting a butterfly garden that would attract the butterflies once the primary children had observed the life cycle indoors and freed them into their natural habitat. One of her parent volunteers, Sara Baren, teaches Urban Forestry at UBC. She enlisted the help of Emily Tu, newly accepted to do a MA in Landscape Architecture, to work on the project.\nThey were instrumental in helping Ms. Phoenix to plant indigenous plants that would serve this purpose. The Grade twos used books and iPads to research the traditional uses of the plants by the Musqueam and that are now widely available in grocery stores.\nOur Grade 5 teacher, Melody Ludski, is currently doing her graduate work while teaching full time. She has extensive background knowledge on Indigenous ways on knowing, as well as incredible sensitivity to the protocols required because we work, learn and play on the unceded lands of the Musqueam people. To celebrate National Indigenous Day, Ms. Ludski booked accomplished Pow Wow dancer Shyama Priya, who has Cree roots on her mothers side. She was taught by Coast Salish pow wow dancer, Curtis Joe. She took the time to share the story of creating her regalia and engaged kids and teachers in dancing that reflected amazing skill and athleticism. I was fortunate to go to a few pow wows with my friend, Latash Nahanee, many years ago and join in the dancing during the grand procession. The only word for the heartbeat of the drum and the communal participation – Joy! You could see it on Shyama Priya’s face and those of the children.\nThe Garden Committee, headed up by Grade 1 teacher, Kate Foreman, for many years has been planning an outdoor learning space. Two portables were removed from our school site this year and the perfect opportunity presented itself. Many teachers were very inspired by the idea of a circle with twelve large rocks for seating an entire class. The size of the rocks and the placement to reflect true north, south, east and west were carefully planned and facilitated. As a history major, I loved the possibility of reflecting Indigenous Culture as an early instigator of a democratic system. Everyone has a voice in the talking circle and respect for divergent opinions is a basic tenet. The Vancouver Board of Education was gifted a Musqueam word by Shane Point: Nə́c̓aʔmat ct It means ‘we are one’. Our Nə́c̓aʔmat ct Circle will be a talking circle for problem solving, a listening circle to teach empathy, a way to incorporate medicine wheel teachings and understanding of the circle or life and the seasons and relationships with ourselves, others and Mother Earth.\nThe work of Laura Tait has been inspirational in helping our staff “to push the paddle deeper” in our School Growth Plan. We will be developing and progressing through our own adapted version on the rubric based on her Aboriginal Understandings Learning Progression from SD68 Aboriginal Education. I am so excited that another inspirational colleague, Joyce Perrault, will be helping us to navigate the path. With her drum and her newly published book, All Creation Represented, we will be exploring the Medicine Wheel from an Ojibwe perspective while sitting in our Nə́c̓aʔmat ct Circle. The book states that it’s a child’s guide to the Medicine Wheel but with all I’m learning, the next hardcover, coffee table edition will be marketed to adults. The book provides insight into relationships with ourselves, each other and Mother Earth. I am feeling joyful and optimistic too. We are heading out on a promising journey with optimism and joy and determination that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples will be respected in this chapter of Canadian history.\nNote: The phonetic pronunciation of nə́c̓aʔmat ct is knot-sa-mots."

The gigs will mark the first time he's performed live with a DJ since the death of his partner DJ AM in August. But, as Barker told MTV News earlier this month, he had always considered working with Trak on a project of some sort. And after the two jammed a bit last year, both men knew they had to take their show to the stage.\n\"I had met A-Trak last year at Coachella, but I had seen a set of his at Avalon in Los Angeles maybe four years ago, with AM,\" Barker told MTV News. \"He was a guy who I always wanted to work with in some way. So I gave him a call.\"\n\"When Travis hollered, I was definitely flattered. We started by jamming once, back in the fall, just came over to the studio, and we did, like, one hour of jamming, which we thought was maybe a half an hour,\" A-Trak added. \"I just started playing records and scratching, and he was playing on top, and it went really, really naturally. It was very fluid. And we stopped and looked at the watch, and it was like, 'Oh, we've been playing for an hour and didn't even realize it.' And I think that solidified for both of us in our minds that we could do this pretty easily.\"\nThe duo will perform versions of each other's remixes (they've reworked tracks for everyone from Eminem and Soulja Boy Tell'em to MSTRKRFT and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), plus new material they've been working on in Barker's Los Angeles studio. Or, at least, that's the plan right now.\n\"It's going to be a mix of everything,\" A-Trak said. \"We're still kind of rehearsing it, but I think it's going to be some songs people recognize, some of the remixes Travis has done, some of my remixes. Just kind of mix it up.\"\nBarker said the duo plan to start small, with the pair of shows at Hollywood's Roxy Theatre, before taking the show wide. Additional shows will follow later in March in Las Vegas, Austin's South by Southwest and Miami.\n\"Our first shows are at the Roxy, and then South by Southwest will probably be a little bit bigger,\" Barker said. \"The Winter Music Conference in Miami will probably be a little bit bigger. But the first ones will be really intimate.\"\n\"We might do a run of side shows in health clubs and saunas,\" A-Trak laughed. \"Just set up in the steam bath and play. It was an idea we had yesterday.\"\nTickets go on sale Thursday. The show will kick off with Rob Roy and Kid Sister before Barker and A-Trak take the stage."

This video has so much life within it, the colors just accent the track so much more. The track overall is a feel good track, and the video gives off some seriously feel good vibes too.\nSide note, it’s damn good to see Daley back on the screen!\nWe all know my support for Daley, so this post is to just show more of it! By the way, if you haven’t bought his album Days & Nights, go do so now!\nAlso I’m in this video, so there is that.\nThis track isn’t the newest, but seeing as I have been supporting Daley since the beginning, I need to have a post for this Pharrell produced track titled ‘Look Up’. ‘Look Up’ followed his UK release titled ‘Broken‘.\n‘Look Up’ has all the right necessities for a feel good song, and can I just say that Daley working with Pharrell is a huge step, and I’m so glad all of this happening. Like I said, it is an all around feel good track, there is nothing negative that can be said with a Daley track. I can’t stress how much you need to purchase this song, go do it!\nLook out for Daley in a city near you if you live in the USA!\nI apologize for taking so long posting this, I definitely have not forgot about it. Daley, who remains one of my favorites since I found him, has graced us with a video for his smash tune titled ‘Broken’. ‘Broken’ to sum it all up is pretty much the male break up anthem and it is perfect in every way. Daley’s vocals have never sounded better, and with each track he puts out from his Days & Nights album gets me more and more excited for the release of it.\nMore recently he has put out a track with rapper Nelly called ‘Heaven‘, which he performed in NYC over the weekend on Good Morning America, hopefully giving him the acknowledgement that he deserves.\nHere’s to ‘Heaven’ gaining some success over here, and here’s to Daley giving us a USA tour before that success hits!\nThose of you who have been following this blog know that I am a huge supporter of semi-newcomer Daley. I have been following his career for quite some time now, and he is slowly getting the credit he deserves with his success of ‘Alone Together’ all over the USA. He has been teasing us with this video for a couple of days now, and it is finally out in full and just like anything he puts out, it doesn’t disappoint at all. STRMOY is perfection, and I’m very much excited to hear his next EP, and soon followed by his album Days & Nights.\nStay tuned friends, this guy is about to blow up!\nThe ever so amazing Daley, releases a short EP, that brings back some of his previously amazing songs from the Those Who Wait mixtape, but also features 3 new songs! ‘Blame The World’ is among one of them, which is not necessarily new since it’s been out in acoustic form for quite some time, but the studio quality is just amazing.

I find taking photos just of the art itself to be a little boring. It seems so obvious… and it seems like kind of a disservice to the art itself, unless you are adding something new or seeing it in a new light. It depends on the art, of course. A photo of a painting always falls flat, but a photo of a statue can be interesting.\nAnd so it was with the emperor here in the Capital Museum in Beijing.\nDo you know how hard it was to get permission to use a tripod in here? It was very very hard. And, the permission part had to be in Chinese, which adds a whole new layer of complexity to the permission-gaining-process. But, luckily I had a little team there helping me out with this stuff, and that made life a lot easier. After all the paperwork was squared away and three redundant layers of government officials were satisfied, the light was perfect for this shot. I rushed over to take it before the ink was dry!"

        "text": "The Eagles “Dream Team” continues to add big names with no apparent regard for money or much or else. Ronnie Brown is the newest member of the Miami Heat of the NFL. He’ll probably be relegated to spot duty at about 10 touches a game. But it certainly helps to have a reliable veteran when your starter is a just over 200 pounds. He may also get looks in the goal-line packages. Brown has shown that he still has quite a bit left, so this signing is not to be taken with a grain of salt. The Eagles are inarguably the favorite in that division and maybe the entire NFC. Rob Ryan may be spouting his mouth off in the lone-star state, but I don’t think that will last for long. The Eagles may just steamroll the East, so long as Jeremy Maclin and Desean Jackson are healthy and happy.\nDown south, somehow the best free agent nose-tackle, Aubrayo Franklin, goes to the New Orleans Saints. This after they had already signed Shaun Rogers to play next to Sedrick Ellis. I don’t know what kind of packages Gregg Williams is dreaming up, but it’s going to be scary. They’ve got three monsters in the middle now. Running lanes are going to be awful tight in the Big Easy. Couple that with their blitzing tendencies and run-up-the-score style, and the Saints may have slid back into contention for the NFC themselves. This move should separate them from the Bucs and Falcons in the early season betting lines.\nFranklin excels in eating up blocks and letting linebackers make plays. Just ask Patrick Willis. He’ll do just that in New Orleans, allowing Big Baby Rogers and Sedrick Ellis to pin their ears back, shoot gaps, and chase quarterbacks. My question is how stupid is the rest of the league to allow this guy to be signed on a one year deal? As many teams as there are playing the 3-4 or simply getting run all over, you’d think a top-shelf nose-tackle would be in demand. Nope, apparently not. I bet a good chunk of teams will regret letting this happen. Unless, Franklin simply shunned them to go for a ring. If that’s the case, he may get his wish.\nThe Eagles better run sweeps if they see New Orleans. The middle will be clogged.\nUpdate: This is getting out-of-hand. Just as I finish writing about one Eagle signing, another happens. Right Tackle Ryan Harris is the newest member of the “Dream Team.” He’ll surely replace the underachieving Winston Justice. This is a monster upgrade on the blind-side for the left-handed Mike Vick. I think you’ll see the difference in his numbers and his health. Harris also more athletic than Justice, allowing the Eagles to design more stretch plays going that way. The main weakness last year was this team’s offense line and it has been totally revamped with first round Fireman Danny Watkins, Evan Mathis, and now this. It’s pretty incredible that they’re able to just stockpile talent like this. Andy Reid has to be feeling pretty good about this roster.\n2011 NFL Preview: NFC East."

That is an easy day hike.\nGee, you'd be a good text editor. I assumed that the average reader would understand that access back and forth by the Tioga Pass Road, the Tioga Pass Road, the Tioga Pass Road (that black, paved thingy called highway 120, that the RV's buzz around on!?)would be restricted. Grrr!\nOf course the hiking trail from the Valley to Tuolumne Meadows is open...so far.\nSorry for the stupid joke. The \"easy day hike\" wouldn't include having to come all the way back the same day!\nActually, the easy day hike is from Olmstead point to the Snow Creek trailhead near Mirror Lake. 12 miles with very little uphill as opposed to 24 miles and about a 1500 foot climb out of Tuolomne over Cathedral (you actually have to top 10,000 at one point to get over 9700 foot Cathedral, and then another climb out of Sunrise. Lots of JMT hikers in Lone Pine last week had to take the Olmstead option (the shuttle was running to Olmstead) To get back to cars or YARTS in the Valley.\nYes, that is a fairly easy hike, with many switchbacks down to Mirror Lake. Once down in the Valley, it passes through an old Indian camp site that is regarded as sacred by local Indians. Before the arrival of the white man, part of the trail was used by Yosemite Indians to travel to the annual Summer encampment at Tuolumne Meadows.\nJust below Olmstead, the trail passes through an area the park rangers call \"Bear Valley\", because it seems to be used a lot by bears roaming back and forth from the high country to the Valley. There are many, many bear scratched trees visible from the trail.\nSeveral years ago I did a trans-Sierra hike with a group of American Indians (a migration re-enactment by tribes from the East and West sides of the range), one section of which went through that area. Before entering \"Bear Valley\" the spiritual leader of the trip warned us to remain silent so as not to awaken the bear spirit that dwells there. He smudged us completely all over and prayed, and then we hiked on through safely with no bear encounters. Non-Indians might think spiritual rituals like that are cute, but Indians take it very seriously. There's a kid's song that starts, \"If you go down to the woods today, you're in for a big surprise...\"\nTioga road is still closed, but Hwy 120 is back open into Yosemite Valley."

You touch people's lives and they yours that would never have happened if not for this marathon. I want to share one encounter that will remain with me forever.\nI was in an elevator, at a motel, while on a weekend away. A young man, very emaciated dripping wet in his bathing suit got in with me. I commented on him taking a swim and he said he took a \"soak\" in the hot tub. The conversation went further, me asking him where he was from and was he on holiday. His response, \"I have given up the will to live and I am checking things off my bucket list.\" My heart dropped and I reached into my purse, saying that I had something for him, and gave him a \"You Matter\" card as we got out of the elevator. He read it, shook his head, and we walked in silence a few feet to our room, which were next door to each other. I heard him mumble under his breath as he entered his room, \"I'll be damned. I matter.\"\nFirst off, Thank You Cheryl for taking a leap and bringing this project to life! I have given my cards in person to 11 strangers and it is an interesting experience. My inner critic speaks up and tells me \"they are not going to get this or they will think you are nuts\"! I'm happy to report that my inner critic has gone silent. Every stranger has had a positive reaction to these cards. I have given them for co workers to find and have sent a few in the mail. I love spreading kindness and love!\nThe cards arrived on time and I am enjoying distributing them so far. People have been positive upon receiving the cards. I look fwd to opportunities to put another smile on someone's face.\nThe \"You Matter\" marathon has been a heart-warming experience for me as I have secretly and sometimes not so secretly delivered this powerful message. These two words have touched the lives of family members, custodians, educational support staff, and security personnel at my school and people who are currently navigating difficult circumstances in their lives. Today over 50 teachers opened a training manual that contained a \"You Matter\" card. I saw the look on their faces. One person had tears in her eyes and others smiled. This group is preparing to facilitate conversations with our 9th graders on topics related to identity, dignity/empathy. stereotypes/biases and community. \"You Matter\" = \"We All Matter.\" I can't be me without you.\nI joined the YuMM at the beginning of the month after finding out about it from the GreaterGood website. I enthusiastically signed up to receive my You Matter cards and started my marathon with running shoes on! After handing out a few cards to unexpected strangers and realizing the impact these 2 little words made to each recipient, I decided to pass this good will message on! I lead an \"Inspirational Discussion\" group each week at a senior community where I work. 2 weeks ago I invitated participants to join in on the YuMM movement. I handed out 10 cards to each person to start with, and challenged them to give a card to 10 people of their choosing during the week. The following week at our discussion I asked who they chose to give to, what was the person's reaction and how the group members felt after witnessing their reaction? Each member responded with an overwhelming sense of joy and heartfelt impact from their ability to brighten someone's day and touch their life in an instant. The responses were priceless. More cards were requested and the invitation to join the YuMM was passed on to their friends and family. The ripple effect continues to grow spreading kindness, compassion, and most importantly the message that we all matter and are not alone! Thank you Cheryl for beginning this movement and all you YuMMies who continue this magical marathon!!!\nI've been going to the same dentist for over 30 years. Most of his staff have been with him for as long (or longer). They have literally watched me (and my teeth) grow up. I brought cards for each of them. I took a moment to express how much they mean to me as I handed them a card. There were tears and hugs all around. They have been there for me through traumatic life experiences, not just dental work. They are family to me.\nDay 17 of the YMM and unlike most marathon's this one actually empowers the participant (me) instead of making me way exhausted! Positive vibes incredibly produce MORE instead of less! Thank you for creating this wonderful vehicle to help turn on the light within. I relish each opportunity to share a card. I left one in the locked up postal box for the post-person to find, gave one to the \"Apple Genius\" when he was patiently listening to my computer's woes, the checkout person in the grocery store turned her yawn into a nice smile when she was presented one! And the list goes on....this is one habit I will look forward to integrating into my life, even AFTER the Marathon is finished! ?\nfinding gifts and smiling, laughing, crying, etc.\nA group of psychology students on our campus was participating in a \"Random Acts of Kindness\" event this past week - passing out treats and uplifting quotes at the entryway to the campus. I approached and accepted their offering and then had the joy of sharing a card with each of them. It was fun to add a twist to their activity - and be able to thank them for what they were doing for our community!\nThe first three cards were handed to my teenagers and they each asked for a couple to hand out as well. After coordinating days each would give out their card, they moved on with their day. When the first one handed out a card, they were so shocked that it was received so warmly that they asked to be able to hand out cards all year long. Can anyone say, Christmas presents?! They are having a hard time waiting for their \"day\".\nOn election day in the US, I handed out a card to one of our poll workers I've seen over the years. She started crying and said that she wasn't sure how I knew that she was feeling worthless and unimportant but that the card made her day! We hugged and I sat to talk with her for a bit. What a wonderful feeling for BOTH of us!\nThe next day I handed out a card to a man who said that he felt unimportant and unloved as a result of the election but that the card helped him realize that there are people who love him and his family and want them here.\nThis exercise has not only touched the student who felt suicide was the only answer, the vet on the corner and people normally overlooked but has enriched my life immeasurably. Thank you!\nI gave my first \"You Matter\" card to my partner. He lit up and immediately wanted a bunch to hand out to people.\nToday I gave 22 cards to co-workers. Most of them said they wanted to cry, some hugged me, some said this was EXACTLY what they needed right then, one said I LOVE THIS. It was wonderful for me and for them!\nToday I sent out 5 cards (3 friends, 2 relatives) and slipped in a card for the recipient and two extras for them to share. I decided to 'spread the wealth' and get them in on this wonderful marathon. I have one sitting on my desk by the computer to remind myself that I too am special and worthy. My husband is getting one in his Thanksgiving card. Looking forward to handing out the rest.\nIn every case, each recipient of my card actually fought back tears. They all hugged and kissed me. It was a powerful reminder that doing the right thing, the loving thing, always works, somehow. They also, ALL, have said they'd put the card somewhere visible, to remind themselves that....they DO matter. Thank you for this fantastic opportunity!\nWas hesitant at first to hand out cards but had a new insight the other day - went to the Dollar store and bought multiple thank you cards - for the past lady, the \"paper boy\" the trash collector, the yard man, the house cleaner, the local checkout counter clerk at Publix - and put a card into each card.. Just staring with that but seems comfortable to say thanks at the same itime.\nThank you, thank you, thank you for this beautiful movement of love and peace! I was thrilled when I opened your handwritten envelope (a rarity these days) and found the cards! The first feeling that I had was gratitude to you for conceiving this precious gift. It is like a ray of purple sunshine!\nMy first card went to a counselor at the Hazelden Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, who is working hard to help people recover from their addictions. The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation has been saving lives and restoring families from substance abuse and addiction for more than 60 years. It felt wonderful to acknowledge his healing power.\nThe rest of the cards will be handed out randomly, as I travel across the country in the next month. They will go to people who do the simple tasks that help us flourish, yet, who are seldom recognized. In this way, with intention, they will help me to focus on the acts of loving kindness around me.\nThank you for your generous act of reminding us of this simple, yet, profound message.\nEspecially at this moment, in America and in the world, You Matter.\nOn 11/08/16 my husband and I went to our local polling place to vote. There was a problem with the machine that accepted the completed ballots. While waiting in line while the machine was being looked at, I spotted 2 on-duty police officers from our town standing to my right. I opened my purse and took out 2 YOU MATTER cards. Before we left, I handed one to each officer. Each thanked me as they looked at their card. With all the negativity in the news lately about police officers, I was so moved to pass out the first 2 cards I had given out to 2 police officers. This is a great \"marathon\" and I feel humbled to be part of it. Thank you so much!\nI sent several of the YOU MATTER cards through the mail. One in particular was to an old college roommate. I received a heart felt emiail THANKING me for the card. She received it the day after the elections. She was very discouraged with the results and the card helped bring everything into perspective. She says she will pass it on.\nInitially I was a bit embarrassed to give out the You Matter card ?. But I had pledged to do it, so I set myself to it. The first one I left to be found, then I thought that was a bit of a cheat. So the next one I gave to a supermarket checkout lady. \"Thank you--you've made my day\". That encouraged me to give out more. At first I gave them to women thinking men might think they were fluffy or embarrassing.\nNo, just do it, I said to myself. I gave a card to the male receptionist at a youth centre--a moment of incomprehension, and then a big smile. \"Thank you!\"\nIn this time of anger and alienation, I encourage you to reach out with two words, you matter. No matter how hard it is to get over that reserve, it is really worth it.\nAs I read the posts this morning, I realized I wanted to gift myself a card....or maybe several around the house where I will see them all day: to help me remember myself and my guy with more love and appreciation.\nI have thoroughly had a blast with this Marathon! As I was leaving my weekly therapy appointment at the DPT Institute, the parking lot has designated parking for it's clients, Knowing how I FEEL after a group or individual therapy session a parked car seemed Just perfect to leave a \"You Matter\" card ion the windshield! ?"

This year might be considered something of a cheat, as it is an installment of MEMORY, the ongoing, online serial project of mine. I choose to think otherwise, however, mainly because I've been so wrapped up with other things it's been an unforgivably long time since I chronicled the adventures of Flavius and Parric. I'm still far too busy with different projects not to mention far too slow a writer, but for today, at least, Flavius and Parric live on. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you and yours!\nFlavius leapt, the new sphere emitting a deep peal as he landed upon it. Upward they soared, knocking and jostling for position. Through the chaos of the spheres, Flavius glimpsed the service way, far to his left.\nGritting his teeth, he leapt again, and again. Each jump brought him closer. On his next jump, the sphere rolled, dumping him over. He hit the next sphere awkwardly, and tumbled sideways as it rolled as well. Again and again he fell, unable to regain his balance, until finally he landed and stuck, flat on his back.\nApproaching quickly from above came the service way.\n\"Ach, this is gonna sting...\" Flavius grabbed at the support struts underneath the walk an instant before the sphere hit. The impact knocked the air out of him, and for a moment Flavius knew he'd be crushed. The sphere rolled to the side then, and Flavius hooked an arm around the strut before he fell. Heaving a few deep lungfulls of air, he shoved Memory onto the walk, then hoisted himself over the railing onto the service way. His legs quivered warningly. Wiping his face with a sleeve, he scanned the service way for Anacaona, the Empress and the rest. There, far down the service way, amid the cascade of spheres, the orange bulk of Djserka lurched along, followed by the smaller figures of the women.\n\"Right then. Always the running after and catching up.\" Flavius stooped to pick up Memory, and suddenly the world twisted, stretched, then snapped back into place.\nFlavius found himself lying prone on the walk, Memory beneath him. \"What,\" he managed, climbing back to his feet, \"in God's good name was that?\"\nHe tested his limbs cautiously, wary they might break off at the joints or turn to limp strands of rope, but all seemed in order, save for the deep burn of over-exertion. Flavius charged after the others.\nThe service way grew steeper as he approached the others. It was impossible to see far through all the rising spheres, but Flavius was certain the walk hadn't torn loose from its supports. The Palace of Un-pic Ja'ab was listing.\nAnacaona caught sight of him, waving and shouting. Then reality buckled once again. The palace turned inside out, boiling away in a thunderous gale.\nAs quickly as before, reality snapped back to normal. Flavius stared up into the sobbing face of Anacaona, her tears raining down upon him.\n\"Oh, Flavius, what's happening? What was that?\"\n\"I donnae ken, Lass, but it cannae be good.\" Flavius shot a look to the others. \"Empress?\"\nEmpress Malinche, scowling imperiously, offered only a terse shake of her head. Even Papantzin's guise of cool confidence had cracked, as she scanned randomly about for a host of perceived threats.\nThe service way shuddered. A series of rolling booms echoed around them as the Ketza'qua strained against its bonds.\n\"If I may, there is an egress but a short distance ahead,\" Djserka said. \"At this point, it is my belief the Ketza'qua will cast off its bonds long before we are able to make our way back to the Nexial gaps. The palace will not last much longer, I fear. Our best course would be to vacate.\"\n\"Then forward, ya beastie! Move!\"\nWith Djserka in the lead and Flavius in the rear, they fought their way toward the door even as the way grew steeper. The tilt was unmistakable now, nearly ten degrees by Flavius' reckoning. The lifting spheres no longer rose directly past, but rather increasingly angled the same direction they moved. And the flow had slowed as well.\n\"The way forward is blocked,\" Djserka announced abruptly. \"I cannot force a way through.\"\nFlavius leaned over the rail, but couldn't see beyond Djserka's bulk. The way back, even if they wanted to retreat, was already blocked by coagulating spheres. \"I could climb past ya, but I nae want to be skewered by yer spines there.\"\n\"It is possible for me to retract my defensive spicules temporarily.\"\n\"Then get retracting.\" Flavius swung himself over the railing, muscling for space against the spheres. \"The rest of ya, follow along.\" Anacaona clutched his arm.\n\"Flavius... uh, please be careful.\"\nFlavius patted her cheek. \"Ah, lass, had ya only offered me that sage advice a week ago.\"\nFlavius gingerly worked his way along the railing, wary of the warty black puckers of retracted spines. This close to the Naga-ed-der, he could smell the creature's astringent odor. Flavius blinked as his eyes watered. Anacaona followed close behind, with the Empress and Papantzin after. As Flavius reached the front, Djserka plucked him over the rail with a long, spindly arm, then helped Flavius pull the rest over.\n\"Stay close. When I start cutting,\" he said, \"I donnae ken how long the path will stay open--\"\n\"So keep pace or be left behind,\" finished Empress Malinche impatiently. \"Yes. You've said that already.\"\n\"Right. But it, ah, bears repeating.\" Flavius swung Memory in a wide arc, shattering two spheres. Feather-light crystal shards rained down on him. He pushed forward, before the crush of spheres could fill the gap, and slashed again, breaking another. The women followed close behind, but the spheres pressed in quickly, making a tight fit for Djserka.\n\"I see it!\" Flavius shouted, steadily smashing his way forward. \"It's only about 20 more feet.\"\nThe doorway loomed ahead, a dark slash against the wall.\n\"Is it opening wider?\" asked Anacaona.\n\"Opening?\" Flavius peered forward. The opening was growing wider. And extending up and down the wall as well. \"Sweet mer--\"\nA cascade of debris fell through the opening, smashing through the straining, buckled struts anchoring the end of the service way. \"That's nae doorway, that's a break in the palace wall!\"\nThe struts snapped. The service way twisted and bucked against the spheres, dropping from a ten degree rise to a twenty degree drop in rough, jerking fashion. Then it rumbled forward, smashing spheres left and right, through the growing fissure in the wall.\nThrough the cloud of dust and rubble they rode, through the breached wall, into the shrill night air. The length of service way snagged back inside somewhere, jerking to a stop. The railing collapsed, dumping Flavius, Anacaona, Empress Malinche and Papantzin into open air.\nFlavius landed on something hard and metallic. Anacaona landed atop him, as did the Empress and Papantzin. \"Get... off!\"\nFlavius pushed them off, and rose to a kneeling position. \"Djserka?\" he called.\n\"Here,\" Djserka said, lowering himself via thread. \"You only fell seven mlara. Any farther and you may have sustained significant injuries.\"\nA burning wej spun out of control in the distance, trailing smoke. Streaks of cuyab flame streaked here and there. Larger plasma beams lanced out from palace gun placements, burning moironteau into shriveled char. Moironteau... moironteau swarmed everywhere. Thousands of them, on the ground, in the air, illuminated by furious eruptions of crimson and emerald throughout the battlefield.\nThe steel-hard surface beneath them undulated then, and a fierce, rapid clattering in the distance rushed over them and past. It was a familiar clatter, one Flavius had heard before. \"Oh, damn me sideways to hell. We're atop the wee beastie.\"\n\"Speak sense, Flavius,\" snapped Empress Malinche.\n\"I believe, Your Imperial Highness, that he means we currently stand upon a scale of the bound Ketza'qua,\" Djserka said.\n\"The Ketza'qua?\" the Empress repeated with distaste. \"For a servitor creature to debase the Imperial Personage with physical contact...\" She shuddered. \"No, no this is unacceptable. It will have to be disposed of.\"\n\"Oh, Yer Imperial Majesty's got much bigger problems than that just now,\" Flavius said, standing ready with Memory gripped tightly in both hands.\n\"The Ketza'qua is breaking free!\" cried Anacaona. \"It will kill us all!\"\n\"Nae, Lass,\" Flavius answered, gesturing Memory toward the raging battle. \"Yer wee beastie willnae get the chance.\"\nThrough the carnage of battle streaked a crimson blur, a serpentine body of scarlet propelled by wings blurred with motion. It raced toward them, its three pair of eyes locked on Flavius, antennae twitching in fury, casting off sparks of pure hatred."

        "text": "Sometimes, if not routinely, a common sense or every day definition does not comport with those found in the New York Penal Law. Whether statutorily defined or established pursuant to legal precedent and decisions, what may seem clear to you may actually be quite different in a court of law. As your criminal lawyer can easily explain, in the eyes of the New York Penal Law, a loaded firearm does not require a bullet in the chamber, magazine, clip or, for that matter, physically in the gun at all. Instead, according to the law practiced in New York State criminal courts involving crimes such as Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Second Degree, New York Penal Law 265.03, a loaded firearm is one that is capable of being loaded, for example, with bullets or ammunition in the same case. Despite what a layperson may think, the law treats these types of “loaded” pistols, revolvers, and other firearms the same. In fact, while a loaded firearm can violate PL 265.03, an unloaded firearm is a distinct crime of Criminal Possession of a Firearm, New York Penal Law 265.01-b(1), carrying a significantly lesser potential sentence upon conviction.\nKeeping this common sense-criminal code dichotomy in mind, what about operability? Does it matter in the eyes of the criminal law – and the prosecuting District Attorney – whether your gun can fire or discharge a bullet? Simply, is operability a mandatory element of any firearm crime found in New York Penal Law Article 265?\nA crime that is routinely prosecuted in New York City, and likely elsewhere through the State of New York, is New York Penal Law 265.01(1), Fourth Degree Criminal Possession of a Weapon. More specifically, if you knowingly possess a gravity knife or a switchblade knife you are guilty of a class “A” misdemeanor. Because of the severity of the crime, its creation of a permanent criminal record as a result of a conviction, and the fact that what the State identifies as a gravity knife often results in regular people being charged with crimes they had no idea they violated, there are many offenders who should consider having their old criminal conviction for PL 265.01 sealed in accordance with New York Criminal Procedure Law 160.59. For that matter, whether you had metal knuckles, a slingshot, shirken, chucka stick or any other per se weapon, conviction sealing is an option to consider.\nOne of the problems with PL 265.01, and reason why it is an offense that you should seek to seal from your criminal record, is that on its face a conviction for any weapon offense has the worst possible connotation for and to a prospective employer. While one might argue a switchblade knife is often associated with a dangerous instrument, a gravity knife can be something as simple as a multi-tool purchased at a hardware store. While this blog does not address the merits of the law, the questions posed here are can you apply to have your conviction for NY PL 265.01 sealed with the passage of CPL 160.59 and is Fourth Degree Criminal Possession of a Weapon an eligible offense?\nNew York State has numerous laws and crimes regulating the use and possession of firearms and other weapons. Whether one is supportive of these statutes such as the Safe Act or not, these laws are some of the most rigid and strict in the nation. While they are all codified in New York Penal Law Article 265, the crimes vary from class “A” misdemeanors to class “B” felonies. There is little dispute that the most common of these offenses is Fourth Degree Criminal Possession of a Weapon, New York Penal Law 265.01(1). However, the types of per se objects that qualify as weapons, including gravity and switchblade knives, may be serious, but not as significant as their firearm related brethren. Of these crimes, those likely prosecuted the most in New York City and at both LaGuardia and JFK Airport in Queens are Second Degree Criminal Possession of a Weapon, New York Penal Law 265.03, and Criminal Possession of a Firearm, New York Penal Law 265.01-b. With that in mind, this blog entry addresses some of the most significant differences between two crimes that are somewhat similar and regularly prosecuted, but drastically different in their potential sentence and punishment upon a conviction.\nYou are waiting in line at JFK or LaGuardia to check your bags and return home to Texas, Florida, Ohio, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia or any other state in the Union. Thinking nothing of it, you declare your firearm to the Delta, JetBlue, American or other airline agent. Not alarmed in the slightest, the agent tells you to wait…and you do just that. Shortly thereafter, police officers with the Port Authority Police Department approach you. Now becoming slightly more alarmed, if you are reading this blog entry you know exactly what happens next.\nI have drafted many blog entries and as a New York criminal defense lawyer represented many clients accused of violating New York Penal Law 265.01, Fourth Degree Criminal Possession of a Weapon. Usually the crime involves either a resident of New York or someone visiting from outside New York City who is unfamiliar with the strict standards of New York crimes involving knives. The law is superficially clear in its application even if it is not known to most New Yorkers. NY PL 265.01(1) codifies the class “A” misdemeanor of knowingly possessing a knife that is either a gravity knife or a switchblade knife. No, this entry will not dwell on the often overreaching impact the crime has on people who use gravity knives at work, purchased them at hardware stores or Amazon.Com, or have no criminal history and completely lacked any nefarious intent. Instead, this entry will review the less common charge of NY PL 265.01(2).\nIt is well settled, and worth getting out of the way right from the start, that operability or a working weapon is generally an essential part of a Criminal Possession of a Weapon charge and crime pursuant to New York Penal Law Article 265. In substance, this means that if a person is accused of possessing a firearm illegally, one of the central elements it that the firearm – gun, pistol, revolver – actually be capable of letting off a shot. This is most easily confirmed through a ballistics test by the police department. If the firearm is incapable of shooting and the ballistics test confirms this failure, then the firearm will not qualify as a firearm for the purpose of certain sections of Criminal Possession of a Weapon. Should it not be operable, your criminal defense attorney would move for a dismissal of the Grand Jury indictment or the criminal court complaint.\nA gun is not always a gun in the eyes of the law. A firearm is not always a firearm as it is defined by New York criminal court judges. An arrest for a can of mace, you guessed it, is not always a can of mace for the purpose of New York Penal Law 265.01. Confusing, right? Maybe not. A critical factor or element to weapon crimes in New York is whether or not that particular weapon is operable. It is not merely enough to possess a firearm, a “dangerous knife” or other “dangerous or deadly instrument” with the intent to use it against another person if operation is required. Certainly, these are elements to PL 265.01(2), but as your criminal lawyer should be able to explain to you, if the object in question is not operable, then you very well could, and likely should, have grounds to seek a dismissal of the Criminal Possession of a Weapon charge for which you were arrested.\nNew York Penal Law 265.01(1), Fourth Degree Criminal Possession of a Weapon, delineates the type of weapons that are per se, aka, automatically, weapons in New York based on the law no matter how you intended on using them. If you knowingly possess the weapon, then you are guilty. No, you are not merely walking into a courtroom with your criminal lawyer and pleading guilty to a misdemeanor crime that is accompanied by a sentence of up to one year in jail, but you are guilty barring certain defenses, such as challenging the probable cause for your arrest and how you were searched. This is because there is a strict liability standard at trial assuming the prosecution proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Looking at it slightly differently, you always have the ability to challenge an arrest on legal, factual, evidentiary, and mitigation grounds, but without any defense, a jury or judge can find you guilty if the People meet their burden.\nPutting aside this strict liability standard and whether or not the NYPD and District Attorney should be prosecuting honest, hard working, regular people who legally purchase one of these gravity knifes at Home Depot, Amazon, a local sporting goods store or any other retailer having no reason to believe that in New York it is a crime to possess such a “weapon,” other types of blades and objects can be considered dangerous instruments and weapons depending on the matter they are possessed or used. The statutory authority to prosecute these crimes is also Fourth Degree Criminal Possession of a Weapon, but is found in New York Penal Law 265.01(2). This entry will address a recent court decision examining the legal sufficiency of a PL 265.01(2) arrest and prosecution in connection to the possession of a box cutter."

        "text": "It’s sometimes difficult to see progress. Often things change so slowly that we don’t see the change happening. Like biological evolution, the changes we see in business and customer service are most often very gradual and hardly noticeable from day to day, they only happen over much longer periods. It’s often surprising, if you look back in time at how much things have actually changed.\nMany of us will remember those days in the past when things were very different. If you’re old enough, cast your mind back fifteen or twenty years and think of the number of loan sharks that were operating in Botswana. Do you remember how they were charging up to 30% interest per month? Do you remember how they were completely ignoring the “in duplum” rule, the rule that says that when a debt is settled the interest charged cannot exceed the remaining capital amount? Do you remember how they were routinely taking people’s ATM cards and sometimes even their Omang cards as insurance that they would repay their loans? Do you remember how there were loan sharks operating from car parks, fried chicken restaurants and in one case I personally witnessed, from a government office?\nWe sent that consumer straight to NBFIRA who no doubt explained to the lender that their conduct was unacceptable and confined them in their dungeons.\nAlso in the past we had hire purchase. Yes, I know we still have it but we did have one minor success in making the cost of hire purchase easier to understand. You might remember that when items were advertised on “credit”, the stores just advertised how much the deposit would be, the number of instalments you needed to make and how much each one would cost you. The stores were ignoring the legal requirement, as expressed in the Control of Goods (Marking of Goods) Regulations 1974 which says that when “goods are offered for sale on hire-purchase terms or by way of credit-sale or on any other terms as to deferred payment” then the details shown must include “the total amount to be paid by way of deposit and instalments”.\nWhen we first discovered this rule we wrote to the Managing Directors of all the stores that sell things on credit or hire purchase and asked them if they knew about this. To their credit, they almost all came back to us apologetically, saying they weren’t aware of it and would change their advertising as soon as possible. One of them was a little bit less cooperative. It doesn’t matter, they said, we abide by South African law. That’s lovely, we told them, then go back to South Africa. In Botswana the laws of Botswana apply, not the laws of another country that you prefer. They eventually complied with the laws of the country that had welcomed them and allowed them to exploit its people.\nAnother thing that has changed, although not completely is the number of people with fake degrees. A number of highly publicised cases involving senior managers and academics who were exposed as having purchased degrees from unaccredited so-called “universities” has made us all a lot more aware of how skeptical we need to be about people’s qualifications. Over the last eight years we’ve warned readers about forty-five different establishments that claim to offer qualifications but none of which actually require their “students” to do any coursework, sit any exams, deliver any dissertations or do any actual work. All they’ve ever required is a credit card number and then, as if by magic (or Mrs Mugabe) a degree certificate is in the post.\nNot all of these crooks have been pleased to be exposed. Several of them have threatened us with all sorts of consequences once they realised their scam was likely to dry up.\nOne of them, calling itself “Headway University” even created a web site for a fake law firm calling itself \"Joyce & Nielsen\" who sent us an email demanding that we retract the accusation that Head way was bogus. They accused us of spreading “defamatory, harmful and malicious content in violation of state, federal and international law … with the intent to harm, defame and cause financial damages to our client, Headway University”.\nI wasn’t sure at the time how it is possible to defame a fake university that sells fake degrees to fake graduates. Defamation rests on the assumption that the victim has a reputation to protect. Peddlers of bogus qualifications are criminals. They had no reputation to lose.\nIt didn’t take too much detective work to discover that the law firm didn’t actually exist. The crooks behind the fake university had created an entirely fake web site to pretend that the law firm existed, even stealing the text on the web site from other, genuine law firms.\nUnfortunately, despite the crooks behind almost all of those bogus establishments being shut down they seem to be reappearing. Just a couple of weeks ago I chatted online to an “advisor” from “Martinville University” who told me that for $500 I could get a degree in Nursing without sitting any exams. For $500 on top I could get a Masters degree as well and he said he would backdate the Bachelors degree to the pair of degrees looked more convincing to a potential employer.\nSo maybe things haven’t changed that much after all?"

        "text": "In the world of token sales, as well as blockchain and ICO services, there is such a thing as Ethereum wallet with Ether tokens in them. You may have come across these terms in your search to raise money through newer technologies. What is it about? Learn more through the following FAQs about Ether.\nEthers were created after the donations made on a 2014 presale. The numbers included a total of 60 million ethers created for those who contributed to the presale, 20% or a total of 12 million of which were created and placed on the development fund. This development fund was made to be given to early developers and contributors. The remaining 80% or 48 million were created to the Ethereum Foundation.\nThere were terms made before the 2014 presale and in these terms, it was agreed upon by the parties that the annual supply is capped at only 18 million ethers per year. It has to be noted though that while the number of ethers issued yearly is fixed, this can be affected by the decrease in relative inflation every year.\nIt is actually intended for developers who are building and will be building apps that will rely upon the Ethereum blockchain as well as users who want to interact and have access to smart contracts within the blockchain.\nHow Do You Access Ether Bought during the 2014 Presale?\nThe sale comes with an Ethereum wallet which likewise comes with a downloadable presale import application. Once you have downloaded the presale import, you will gain automatic access to the ethers you have bought during the 2014 presale. You will need a password to gain access to this app.\nEthers have been created in an Ethereum network which continuously runs through the help of computers worldwide. Rewards are given to any computer which is capable of creating the latest block using the chain. A new block is added to the blockchain every 15 seconds.\nAll latest transactions processed through the computer and Ethereum network which was able to generate this block will be awarded a total of 3 ethers. Take note though that each block generation comes with an algorithm thus the rewards are given randomly depending on the computational power of the machine used in the network. This is what the concept of mining is all about.\nAre Bitcoin and Ether Related?\nRemember that the Ethereum network has been built because of the presence of the Bitcoin. Ethereum uses a currency complementary to Bitcoin and the digital environment. Ether is more of a token used in order to pay for computation and must not be considered as an asset, a share or currency.\nYou can also use Bitcoin in the Ethereum network in a number of ways. The first option is to trade Bitcoin for Ether by executing contracts and later on trading it back thus keeping the value secured by Bitcoin. The Ethereum wallet includes automatic conversion from ether to Bitcoin. Another is using a pegged derivative where you must have a trustworthy Bitcoin source that will allow you to create Ethereum currency with a value that is pegged to the Bitcoin's current market value."

        "text": "OK folks so it’s Chinese New Year and the pig has chased off the chicken and now rules the roost.\nApparently anyone who is born in the year of the pig is studious and gallant, has tremendous inner strength, will not hesitate to strive for their goals, is quiet but well informed, kind, affectionate and loyal for life. Long story short, in China, being a pig is actually pretty darned cool.\nHere at Mandarin Film, our annual Chinese New Year tradition is to share the ten most mind-blowing locations that we have had the pleasure of filming at this year. If you’re curious about filming in China or partnering with us on a project, please feel free to reach out!\nYes, floating solar farms are a thing, and of course, in China they are the biggest and the best.\nThe vast fields of panels that sit atop the Yangtze river are known as the largest floating solar project in the world. Having said this, given the brisk pace China is building more renewable projects, it’s unlikely to hold that title for very long.\nThe floating power plant will produce enough energy to power 15,000 homes. Building on bodies of water, especially manmade lakes that are not ecologically sensitive, helps protect agricultural land and terrestrial ecosystems from being developed for destructive energy use. The water also cools the electronics in the solar panels, helping them to work more efficiently.\nThe panels featured in Our Planet, a film for Netflix by Silverback Films in association with WWF. See the Trailer here.\nCar shoots in Shanghai are pretty standard, but our client Final Frame in Germany wanted to make this one stand out – so we bridged that valley to get extra super-duper cool locations for the Hella shoot. Nanpu Bridge is as rad as bridges get in Shanghai – and of course you need to shoot it with a drone to get the full effect. This video recently won gold at the New York Festival TV and Film Awards. See our number one location slot below for Britain’s schoolboy answer to Nanpu Bridge.\nThe Beijing Swift is so famous it is the emblem of Beijing’s foremost beer. The swift nests in some of the city’s most spectacular locations – including the Summer Palace and Zhengyang Gate at Tiananmen Square, presenting tricky access challenges for the filming crew. In this film we worked with the BBC to overcome access obstacles and film these amazing birds that fly 30,000 kilometers a year and rarely touch the ground.\nWild Metropolis is a new landmark three part wildlife series made for the BBC with co-producers Tencent (China) and PBS (US).\nYes – virtual locations are still locations! In this case, shooting Genghis Khan battlefield plates and short scenes on the Mongolian Steppe for a huge computer game franchise.\nThis was our producer Shan Shan’s favorite ever shoot – even though it was foggy every day and the whole shoot needed to be squeezed into the few hours on the final day when the fog finally lifted. Phew!\nIn early 2018 US news site Upworthy, http://www.upworthy.com commissioned Mandarin Film to produce a short video as part of a global series about long term change-makers, entitled ‘the Long Game’.\nWe arranged at Heqing, Yunnan Province in China’s far South-West corner, to film TNC’s work around Plateau Wetland and Bird Habitat Conservation. We were blown away by what we witnessed. Amongst the rapid development of the area what we found was a quiet, clean heaven for birds of every stripe, and a paradise for bird watchers and nature-lovers.\nFood is a national obsession in China, and food junkies will go to any extremes to get their gastronomic fix.\nFood Unwrapped is a long-running popular Channel 4 TV show that travels the world exploring the industry secrets behind our favourite foods.\nHighlights of the shoot included capturing Matt Tebutt opening a freshly fished clam to discover dozens of pearls inside, Jimmy Doherty making traditional soy sauce at a picturesque riverside with 3000 pots of fermenting soy beans and, the star of the show – a five year old boy showing our host how to forage bamboo shoots on the wild film set of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nFrom JiayuGuan – The Great Wall’s westernmost watchtower in the desert, to the tropical lush waterfalls of Detian, these were some of the most challenging shoot locations in all of China. The journey led our multiple camera crews from the furthermost border of Horgos in north-west of China, to Pingxiang at the China-Vietnam border in the south west, Mandarin Film took these teams across half of China to make this challenging show happen.\nThe beautiful karst landscapes of south west China make a dramatic backdrop to the death defying free solo climbs of the langurs troupes. Move over Alex Honnold - Langurs, some as young as six months old, make these daily climbs from the forest floor to their citadels on the cliff tops.\nMandarin Film is co-producing a new one hour wildlife documentary with Earth Touch for CCTV9, Smithsonian and ORF. This 4K documentary will showcase these critically endangered langurs in their breathtaking karst homeland of Guangxi. Already in production, watch out for these cliff-climbing primates with white mohicans and bright orange babies in summer 2020!\nMandarin Film is producing a new TV and interactive webseries following travel adventurer Ash Dykes on his mission to be the first person to walk the entire length of the Yangtze River. The show is provisionally entitled Walking the Yangtze: Into the Heart of China.\nClick here to see estimated timelines for when Ash is expecting to pass through the different stages of the journey and follow him in real time on the Live Tracker to see if he is on target to set a new world record..\nFrom in-car saunas to goose-intestine hot pot, million-dollar luxury cars to three-wheeler stunts, the China episode of Amazon Prime’s ‘The Grand Tour’ is a sight to behold.\nThe show was Amazon Video’s most watched premiere episode, and although no viewing figures are available，it is generally regarded as one of the most watched TV shows in the world, even surpassing Game of Thrones in terms of ‘most illegally downloaded show’!\nThe shoot took place in several provinces in South China, and included scenes of the presenters exploring China, driving some amazing roads and performing dare-devil stunts. One of the many challenges of the shoot was to get temporary driving licenses for the cast and crew. Something that had never been permitted before. We filmed a million dollar car, and gained support from different local government bodies allowing the crew to film on the jaw-dropping highway and bridge constructions of China’s stunning southern mountain areas.\nWatch out for the schoolboy bridge scene….\nThe Grand Tour is a British motoring television series for Amazon Video, presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May.\nThe show was Amazon Video’s most watched premiere episode, and although no viewing figures are available is generally regarded as one of the most watched TV shows in the world, even surpassing Game of Thrones in terms of ‘most illegally downloaded show’!\nMandarin Film worked with UK-based production company Chump Productions to create and shoot an episode on China for the third season of the series. A Mandarin Film team of producers helped source stories and characters and then worked on the laborious task of getting China-wide permissions for importing cars, obtaining driving licenses and getting permits for a crew of more than 80, with over fifteen vehicles for a two week shoot.\nThe shoot took place in several provinces in South China, and included scenes of the presenters exploring China, driving some amazing roads and performing dare-devil stunts. One of the many challenges of the shoot was to get temporary driving licenses for the cast and crew. Something that had never been permitted before. Mandarin Film also managed to gain support from different local government bodies allowing the crew to film on the jaw-dropping highway and bridge constructions in the stunning southern mountain areas. The shoot was a huge success and will be aired in early 2019.\n“In winter, swifts hibernate all the way to Africa. And in Spring, they fly all the way back to Beijing and to this exact building where they had built their nest before. This means flying over 30,000 kilometers a year. No matter how harsh the journey, nothing can waver their will of coming back home. ” said Professor Gao Wu while holding a baby swift tenderly in his hand, during his recent swift ringing event once a year at the Summer Palace. Wild Metropolis covered this year’s swift ringing event, as part of the Beijing Swift story.\nWild Metropolisis a new landmark three part wildlife series made for the BBC with co-producers Tencent (China) and PBS (US). Mandarin Filmhelped with all aspects of the production to film the Beijing Swifts, at various swift habitats around the city.\nThe series will reveal the world’s most extraordinary wildlife living in the newest and fastest changing habitat on the planet – human cities. Filmed across the world, the series aims to experience the most-loved and familiar cities through fresh eyes… the eyes of the animals that live in them. The story filmed in Beijing focuses on the Beijing Swift, which has been associated with the city for hundreds of years, nesting in some of the city’s most spectacular locations – including the Summer Palace and Zhengyang Gate at Tiananmen Square.\nKey challenges for the production were obtaining the permissions to access some of the most closely guarded national cultural relics like Tiananmen Square and the Summer Palace, and moreover, to film wildlife’s living habitat in a busy city like Beijing.\n“As a city resident, we rarely look into the sky of Beijing or ancient architecture, and pay attention to observe the birds this long. The Beijing Swift fly extremely fast and in various patterns. Unlike filming in the wild, to film animals in the city we need take people and traffic into consideration. The nests are often high and inaccessible. With a bit of problem-solving, coordination with key locations and NGOs and a lot of patience, we managed to get some amazing shots which perfectly embody the co-existence of human and animal. I can’t wait to see the final film!” Shan-Shan Wang, – Mandarin Film Producer.\n“ I just wanted to say thanks again for all your hard work during our shoot in Beijing – everything went so smoothly and I know was down to your hard work behind the scenes. ”– Director/Researcher, BBC Wild Metropolis.\nWorking closely with CARFTE (The Chinese Association for Radio, Film and Television Exchange), Mandarin Filmwas able to obtain permissions for all of the filming sites and appropriate visas for the foreign crew.\nWild Metropolisis now in post-production stage, and will be released in 2019 on BBC, Tencent and PBS.\nFrom tins of bamboo shoots and cloves of garlic to noodles and tea, in this food unwrapped China special Ricochet wanted to explore the origins of China’s amazing foods.\nFood safety can be a sensitive subject in China so we had to navigate those sensitivities whilst dealing with complicated visas and permitting, always with an eye on researching great stories that would chime with a UK audience. Without giving too much away we found some incredibly entertaining and yet informative stories across China, filming simultaneously with two separate crews in 8 different cities across Beijing, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu Provinces over 10 days.\nHighlights of the shoot included capturing Matt Tebutt opening a freshly fished clam to discover dozens of pearls inside. Other great moments were host Jimmy Doherty making traditional soy sauce at a picturesque riverside with 3000 pots of fermenting soy beans and later foraging bamboo shoots on the film set of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nMandarin Film provided full production services from research, location scouting, logistics and official permissions, to crew, equipment and production staff on the shoots."

        "text": "Robert Kaplan is a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School. In his new book, What to Ask the Person in the Mirror, he argues against the notion that great leadership is about having all the answers. He believes that leadership skills can be learned--and that many of these skills require executives to rethink their conception of what a superb leader actually does. Developing and practicing these skills requires hard work and may demand that talented executives overcome some degree of discomfort and even anxiety in order to raise their game.\nWhen CEOs ask Rob Kaplan for answers, he responds \"Most leaders spend a lot of their time looking for answers. Very often, they may feel isolated and alone. I want to help them refocus their attention on framing and then discussing the key questions that will help them regroup, mobilize their team, formulate a plan of action, and move forward.\" Not surprisingly, this is the focus of TEC as well.\n1. Have you developed a clear vision and key priorities for your enterprise?\n\" The leader may have a clear vision in his or her head but has not communicated it effectively throughout the organization. Leaders need to ask whether they articulate a clear vision and, just as importantly, whether their key employees can re-articulate this vision in a consistent manner.\"\n2. Does the way you spend your time match your key priorities?\n“If you hate doing something, you are likely to avoid it. Conversely, if you love doing something, you are likely to arrange your time so you can do more and more of it.\"\n3. Do you coach and also solicit feedback from your key subordinates?\n\"Ironically, the executives most in need of feedback are very senior,\" and “may have become isolated or not realize that their direct reports have constructive advice regarding specific changes they need to make to improve their leadership effectiveness.\" If they become a TEC member, their peers will also provide this feedback.\n\"Leadership is a team game,\" Kaplan says. \"You have to solicit help from others or you're likely to under-achieve your potential.\"\n4. Do you have a succession-planning process in place?\nKaplan stresses the importance of developing potential successors for key positions in your company-including your own. Then use this list up-and-comers to delegate more extensively to them. This also allows senior leaders more time to achieve a better match between their own time and key priorities. Leaders who fail to train successors risk not only doing too much themselves but also losing these valuable employees, who can become frustrated that they aren't being challenged to build their skills and careers at the company.\n5. If you had to design your company today with a clean sheet of paper, what would you change?\nIt's natural for companies to fall out of alignment with achievement of key objectives in a rapidly changing world. Too often, leaders don't realize how off-track they are until serious damage has been done to the business Kaplan likens the situation to realizing your health is at risk only after you're stricken with a heart attack.\n6. Do you act as a role model?\nLeaders don't always realize that their actions set an example for the people who work for them.\n7. Are you reaching your potential and being true to yourself?\nClick here for the complete article in the July 18 issue of Working Knowledge from the Harvard Business School."

After all, as many people who have dated introverts discover, once they get to know their inner qualities, they can be excellent partners.

These workshops bring together diverse “dream teams” of leading professionals, graduate students, and undergraduates, in a truly cooperative, intensive, and substantive effort to advance the state of the science.\nThese workshops constitute a continuation of the well known Johns Hopkins University summer workshops, and encompasses all areas of human language technology including automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, topic detection and tracking, information retrieval and extraction, summarization and question answering, and certain related areas of computer vision, including image understanding and visual scene analysis.

All of the alternative currencies are negligible in terms of size and scope: electronic transactions using bitcoin worldwide amount to only 16% of the electronic transactions conducted in the Czech koruna, a currency used by just 10.5m people.\nA more fundamental issue is bitcoin's constantly changing purchasing power. Money is a means for paying and settling transactions, a unit of account and a store of value. Swift changes in purchasing power are the enemy of any good currency. If a currency is losing value, people want to get rid of it quickly. In contrast, if it is gaining value, they hoard it.\nThe key principle of bitcoin is that its supply will be fixed, which makes it inherently volatile. This is the antithesis of our elastic money system, which is based on the principle that to keep the purchasing power of money relatively constant the amount of money has to change flexibly over time. The monetary policy lesson of the late 19th and 20th centuries is that price stability matters. People may take it for granted but this is the most beneficial feature of money in its present form and the monetary policy behind it. People can use a currency and not even think about why they trust it.\nCentral bankers have failed to explain that one of the key reasons for their actions during and after the 2008 financial crisis was to maintain price stability. This sometimes required unorthodox policies.\nPeople tend to be concerned about too much money being 'created', but they typically have little idea about the size of the money supply. When I ask well-educated audiences, I often get wildly wrong estimates for the money supply but fairly precise ones for the inflation rate. Price stability, not money supply, matters.\nAs long as central bankers abide by this principle, there is no reason to fear that our existing monetary system will be replaced by a fixed-money alternative.\nIn recognition of the growing importance of financial technology, OMFIF is running a 'Focus on fintech' series. It aims to provide expert analysis of developments in areas including cybersecurity, digital currencies, decentralised ledger technology, big data, regulation and financial inclusion.

Warm sesame bread joins the party, a total lunchtime treat.\nInviting doorways sweeten the air with a stew of dates, figs and cinnamon gently simmering lamb into tender obedience. Fetid whiffs of rotting rubbish, poor drainage and fish carcasses are partly masked by freshly popped corn and street vendors conjuring candy floss. Lights above the labyrinth of narrow crooked passages fade in and out to the tune of power surges. Old men sit and watch children chase each other at warp speed, adults enjoy an evening passeggiata and satisfy their sweet fix with nutella crepes.\nKnown as the Windy City, a trip to Essaouira is a mecca for kitesurfers (our primary motivation) and windsurfers (Planet Kitesurf Holidays). A shared space for all including camels and horses, a wide sandy bay stretched out like a lazy dog with orange blush sunsets silhouetting late afternoon surfers. Oversized studded wooden doors fill arches on antiquity, concealing intricately tiled courtyards with triple heighted spaces, proud palm trees and elegant Islamic architecture charmed by colonial furnishings such as Villa de L’O and Heure Bleue.\nPulling focus, Essaouira’s sophistication lies in its imperfect beauty, a desire not to try and impress but simply be. Holidyaing in Essaouira is a Moroccan oasis of calm and a mouthful of vowels."

I was told by my advisor that LV Prasad Eye Institute in India would be a great place to be for an away rotation during my 4th year. Supposedly, not only would I learn a lot because of how advanced they are in their surgeries, but it would also be something that would help me stand out, talk about in interviews, etc.\nHas anyone ever been to LV Prasad? Or heard anything about it? They've been hard to contact through e-mail (it's taken a month to exchange 2 emails).\nwell, since no one replied, i'd just like to say that spending a month at LV Prasad was one of the best decisions I made in med school (if you're going into ophtho). it was tough at times, but you will definitely learn and see a lot.

But she has now received notification that her application has been turned down because she had not paid the new £500 NHS surcharge.\nMrs Hawkins, who had discretionary leave to remain in the UK and intended to apply for citizenship, said she did not receive the letter from immigration authorities relating to the charge.\nShe had already paid more than £600 applying for her visa and must now resubmit her application or face being deported. She has also been told she cannot work in the UK as her discretionary leave to remain was not renewed. In addition, she must also wait for 10 years before applying for British citizenship, rather than the previous two years.\nMrs Hawkins, who lives in Distington, Cumbria, told the Workington Times and Star: “I just want a fair chance. I have paid all my taxes and national insurance. I have never claimed any benefits even though my visa allowed me to do so.\nShe said she had not received the letter relating to the NHS charge. She is also waiting for the authorities to return her certificate which proves she speaks English, which she needs to resubmit her visa application.\nIf Mrs Hawkins is forced to leave the UK, she will not be allowed to return for a year and if she is deported, she faces a 10-year wait before she can reapply for a visa. The Hawkins family have contacted their MP, Jamie Reed, over the issue and their eldest daughter Kimberley has started an online petition in support of her mother."

        "text": "When the ignition key is turned to the ON position, electricity flows from the ignition switch to the CHARGE light and then to the D+ terminal of the voltage regulator. (The CHARGE lamp internal resistance acts to limit the current and to give a visual indication that the lamp is OK). This small current then flows through the voltage regulator from the DF terminal on the voltage regulator to the DF terminal at the brush holder at the rotor, then into the rotor via the carbon brush and slip ring. It then flows out the rotor via the other brush and slip ring to ground. This makes a complete electrical circuit, and the small amount of current flowing through the rotor induces a small magnetic field in the rotor. The CHARGE light will be brightly lit.\nWhen the engine is started and the rotor is rotating the rotor magnetic field is transformed into AC in the non-moving stator windings. Six small diodes on the diode board change a small amount of the produced electricity into DC, and this is then supplied back to the voltage regulator. As engine RPM increase to the point that the small diodes can supply 12V to the regulator, it reaches the point where the voltage regulator has 12v on both sides. The voltage drop across the voltage regulator becomes zero and the CHARGE light will extinguish.The small diodes continue to produce more current as engine RPM increase and fully power the rotor . From this point on the system no longer requires excitation and it continues to supply itself.\nThere are also six high power diodes mounted on the diode board. They are connected to the stator main output windings (same as the 6 smaller diodes). As the rpm, and therefore the voltage in the alternator stator rises higher than the lamp-extinguishing point, these large six diodes begin to pass current directly to the battery. The current is rectified from AC to DC by these 6 large diodes, which consist of 3 positive and 3 negative diodes. The system relies on the high resistance of the diodes to prevent reverse flows from the battery and discharging the battery when the the engine is not running.\nThere are three common failure modes of the CJ750 alternator system.The alternator charging light (or lack of it) can provide a diagnosis of the system problem.\n1) Check that the Alternator light bulb is good.Wiring color codes and even alternator warning light color can differ from bike to bike, so to identify the charge light check which of the bulbs in the headlight shell has one side connected to the power distribution bar and the other side is coonected to the voltage regulator. If the alternator charge light bulb is blown the alternator will not charge.\n2) Remove the front engine cover and trace the wire that runs from the voltage regulator down to the front of the alternator (DF). Ground this wire and check if the alternator light comes on. If it does come on, proceed to step 3. If it doesn’t, then go back and check again for 12v+ feed in series from the ignition switch to the alternator bulb holder,then to the D+ terminal on the voltage regulator and then from the DF terminal on the voltage regulator to the DF terminal on the stator housing.if the circuit is not broken somewhere the light must illuminate when the DF terminal is grounded.\n3) If the Alternator light comes on when the warning light wire is grounded, check the rotor for open circuit. To do this first lift the brushes and hold them away from the brass slip rings. Using an Ohmmeter, check if there is continuity between the two slips rings. The meter should read a resistance of approx 4 ohms. If there is no continuity the rotor needs to be replaced.\n2) Stator failures are uncommon, however to test your stator measure between the “N” terminal on the stator and each of the three phases individually. The resistance of each phase should be approx 0.6 ohms.\n3) To test the voltage regulator simply bridge the D+ and DF wires. If the light goes off then the voltage regulator is faulty.\nIf the alternator light glows dimly when increasing engine RPM.\nThe most common cause of this symptom, is a poor earth or battery connection, problems with the brushes or the loss of one of the 3 phases from the alternator. It is recommended that before replacing the diode board the voltage regulator and brushes be checked as Diode board failure is not common."

        "text": "Robot Mode: The entire concept of the Star Wars Crossover line of toys is for familiar Star Wars vehicles to transform into their signature pilots. For the evil Empire’s various TIE models this means, of course, those guys in the black variant of the standard Stormtrooper armour. We saw them briefly in all three original movies, I believe. And the robot mode of this toy nicely manages to depict these evil pilots.\nOf course they aren’t entirely black, as the bluish-grey parts of the TIE bomber have to go somewhere and there are those two big wing panels. These go onto the arms of the robot, looking nicely like big shields, and as the robot is very nicely articulated, he can bring them to bear in a number of cool poses. The look and colours of the robot actually remind me of Movie Blackout, which certainly isn’t a bad thing.\nWhat else? The TIE Bomber Pilot comes with a missile launcher for a hand weapon, a simple gun launching a black missile. His big lower legs give him a solid stance and articulation is, as I mentioned already, very nice. So bottom line: a very nice robot mode, no complaints worth mentioning.\nAlternate Mode: The TIE bomber is, as the name says, the bomber sibling of the classic TIE fighter and was seen in “The Empire Strikes Back”, bombing asteroids as the Empire was hunting the Millennium Falcon. Between the familiar side panels (the Twin Ion Engines that give the TIE his name) you have a double hull, one being the cockpit (with the little pilot figure inside), the other housing the bombs.\nThe vehicle folds together very nicely (though the transformation is quite a bit harder than it looks), there are no visible robot parts, and the gun / missile launcher can be mounted underneath the fighter. The cockpit opens up to seat the figure. So to sum it up: a fully satisfying vehicle mode, no complaints at all.\nRemarks: Looking back on the Star Wars Crossover Transformers, I’m kind of miffed that they didn’t make it a true crossover instead of just applying the concept of transforming vehicles to the Star Wars universe. I’d have loved a Grimlock who transforms into a robotic Rancor or the Aerialbots as the various Rebel starfighter types. Instead we a got a line of Star Wars vehicles that just happen to transform into robots modelled after Star Wars characters. Don’t get me wrong, there were some nice toys in that line, but overall I think a lot of potential was missed out on here.\nAnyway, the TIE Bomber Pilot was the last SW Crossover toy I bought some years ago and I only now get around to reviewing him because there were always other toys in the pipeline I felt more inspired by. Still, he is a pretty nice toy in both modes and the TIE Bomber happens to be my favourite among the various TIE models. So bottom line: a nice toy. Certainly not a must have, but good."

        "text": "The metaphor of an anchor is very appropriate because when we feel adrift, lost, confused and overwhelmed by parenting it is helpful to put down an anchor to stabilize ourselves and find a calm place in my mind and body. We can rely on the anchor because it is heavy and solid and it won’t let us down.\nThe baby’s crying and you’ve done everything (changed nappy, fed her, cuddled her etc). You want to cry too.\nSchool holidays and the kids are screaming at each other they are bored and you’re clean out of ideas.\nYour toddler’s has just refused to eat his food again and you’ve cooked it just the way he likes it.\nThe sense of calm you get from anchoring can help you find that inner resource and bring it out when and where you need it. You can anchor anywhere at any time and it takes seconds.\nAnd you can teach this technique to your child or young person.\nHelp them choose an anchor that they can easily access anywhere because you need it to be something that doesn’t draw attention to themselves at school or with their friends. If they are in the playground or park, a friend’s house or a birthday party they won’t want to be doing anything strange that their friends will notice.\nGood anchors are natural actions such as picturing you or their pet if they are visual, quietly humming some music if they are auditory or maybe a 'thumbs up sign' if they are kinaesthetic.\nAsk them to close their eyes and think about a time or situation when they feel calm and relaxed, strong and in control. Suggest they imagine themselves there now. Maybe they'd like to go there, draw it or talk about it.\nAsk them - What can you see? Describe the scene as if they are there now, maybe they are actually there. Suggest they increase the brightness and focus on everything in their picture.\nWhat can they hear? Is there music, are people talking?\nWhat are they doing? What is happening? Is it hot or cold, how do they feel?\nWhen they are really feel associated into the situation and as calm and confident as you think they could possibly be, fire the anchor. Do the thing you have decided to do as your anchor.\nWhen they seem to have lost the calm state - you can tell because they might open their eyes or start fidgeting, ask them to pretend to sneeze on an imaginary ice cream. This is a great way to 'break state' .\nRepeat step 1 and ask them again to make the images, sounds and feelings very strong before they fire the anchor.\nRepeat the process. It will probably be quite quick by now.\nNow they have their anchor, suggest they use it whenever they need that resource. You can help them establish different anchors for other resources.\nEven very small children can quickly anchor a feeling of being brave. You will need to help them recall when they were brave and describe it to them as they establish the anchor. Use the same words each time as this helps them remember it for themselves.\n​If you want any help with this process please email me and I'll go through it with you one on one.\nWhy learn to coach children using NLP?\n‘Neuro’ is how we think, based on our values and beliefs about the world we live in and how it works. It’s how we process what we see hear and feel. It’s unique to us.\n‘Linguistic’ is what we say based on those thoughts and our body language, it’s how we express ourselves, how we communicate.\n‘Programming’ is the result we get from what and how we communicate, the patterns of behaviour and the result of how we behave.\nBy getting in touch with what we do unconsciously, the things that have become habits, and make them conscious, we can decide how we might change them in order to get the result we want now.\nIt is about change and the desire to change and make new patterns by examining how we think and what we say and experimenting with other options that will make a difference.\nHow will it benefit parents?\nIn parenting we fall into patterns of behaviour sometimes because that’s what we’ve always done, or it’s what our parents did, what we believe is the ‘right thing’ to do or say and despite evidence that it’s not working we continue to do these things in the hope that one day we will get the results we want.\n‘If we always do what we’ve always done then we will always get what we’ve always got’. I ask parents what they want to change. What is their desired outcome? What do they want rather than what they don’t want. So often parents think in terms of what they don’t want. Tantrums, answering back, disobedience, cheek, untidiness these are often mentioned. Parents use the ‘don’t word all the time. They focus their attention on what’s not going well.\nI encourage them to use ‘towards’ thinking and ask them to notice their children’s good behaviour rather than their ‘bad ‘ behaviour. What you focus on is what you get more of and that is so true in parenting.\nThere are a great many reasons why NLP works so well with kids and young people.\nChildren are like sponges, they soak up new ideas and embrace change and choices. They have not become numbed by bitter experience or resentful. They are open and ready to learn.\nNLP is positive, it is about focusing on what we do want not what we don’t want, focusing on when things are going well, modeling excellence, what we do well and the structure of excellence.\nWe even teach that there’s no failure only feedback, how empowering is that for a child?!\nWe do not prescribe, we give children choices and the more choices they have, the more flexibility and the more control they have in every situation.\nEverything is possible with NLP the only thing stopping a child is the child itself but sadly parents often get in the way by giving them limiting beliefs which we then have to show them how to remove.\nMuch of our work will be with parents because of this and the fact that they will model behaviour that is not resourceful to the child. Whenever possible I will encourage a parent to have a session with me before seeing their child as this prepares them, informs them and enables the child to have a more meaningful conversation with them after their session.\nI have been training NLP Practitioners in working with children and young people for 6 years. I am certified as a trainer through ANLP and my courses are accredited to Sue Knight who trained me.\nIt is on Skype so you can work from your own home, record the session and make notes.\nIt is an individual session which means that you can ask questions as we go along, contribute your own experiences, discuss application of NLP and anything you don’t understand can be immediately explained.\nThe sessions are weekly, giving you time in between modules to absorb and integrate what you have learned and apply it through a short homework exercise which usually involves working with a child or young person.\nIf you intend to work with children and young people then I can offer you the benefit of many years’ specialist experience.\nThe course focuses on working with children whereas most NLP courses are focused on the workplace and on working with adults.\nYou get individual feedback from me on your homework and the opportunity to improve on it. I then invite you to share it in our private Facebook group where you can read other students’ homework and have feedback on your own.\nOnce you’ve qualified you can continue to use the student Facebook group for advice and ideas and I can help or mentor you in any way you need.\nIf for any reason you need to rearrange your session this can be done relatively easily.\nThe final module Module 12 covers marketing your business which is not usually covered on NLP courses.\nMy background is children’s market research for TV companies, publishers and toy companies.\nSo children have been a big part of my life for many years even before I set up NLP Kids, coaching children and young people and training those who want to work with them.\nModule 1 – Introduction to the course and discussion of your personal and professional goals. What is NLP and how it works with kids and parents.\nModule 2 – Establishing your clients’ processing (internal referencing – visual, auditory, kinaesthetic)and explaining it to them. Meta-Programmes and how to use them at school, home and socially. Accessing skills and learning how to transfer them. Learn Anchoring.\nModule 4 – Beliefs of excellence and modelling excellence. Learn Modelling.\nModule 8 – Managing Behavioural Issues including anger. Learn Mindfulness.\nModule 9 – Improve learning skills, focus and concentration. Learn Grounding.\nModule 12 – Marketing, Social Media / Blogging etc.\nSkype sessions have this structure.\nThe course of 12 one hour lessons via Skype, costs £750 paid in advance.\nOn receipt, you will get a copy of ‘NLP Workbook’ and ‘Be a happier parent with NLP’ these will be your reference books for the course.\nI will email the script after each session and you can record the session yourself using Skype or your phone or other device. There will be about an hour of homework. I’m looking for engagement with the content, thoughtfulness as to how you will apply it and something added by you at a personal level based on your own knowledge and work with children. You can SKYPE me at any time to discuss the course content or any questions you have with your assignment.\nAfter the 11th Module you will present a final assignment to me via Skype and other students may join us. These will be individual 30 minute presentations on one element of NLP with Kids. You can choose whatever age group you want to focus on for the exercise and/or what issue. You need to be rock solid on the techniques and skills and show that you can pass these on to us as a model. It won’t be enough just to feed back to me what I’ve taught you. You will need to incorporate your own experience, research and ideas and other students’ work.\nWhy train to work with kids using NLP?\nA question I am frequently asked by NLP Practitioners who have children is \"Why do I need to do your course, I know how to communicate with children.\" But truly it is quite different working with children as a therapist compared to having a load of kids over for a sleepover and finding it a breeze.\nSo I thought I’d share with you just how different it can be. It is based on my experience as a Kids Practitioner, Montessori Teacher, Mum of four and more importantly a Trainer of the NLP Kids Practitioner Distance Learning course.\nFirstly, the child has not self-referred (although I have had a few teenagers who have done so- one even dragged his parents along with him!) so they do not necessarily feel they need to be ‘fixed’. They have made no financial investment in the process nor any emotional investment. Indeed they don’t even want to be there and can think of plenty of far more fun things to do on a Saturday or after school. You don’t even feature on their list.\nThey come into my room, shoulders hunched up, head down with mum saying “say hello to Judy now”. You might get a grunt. They don’t want to be there and they aren’t going to make it easy for you and why should they? This certainly wasn't their idea unlike the vast majority of adult clients you'll see.\nThe second thing is that they're worried they'll 'get it wrong'. By that I mean that in every other aspect of their life they know that there are right and wrong answers. Children are used to adults having ‘the right answer’ in their heads and when they feel vulnerable they are scared that they won’t know what that is. So we always start with some art and craft, a walk round the garden, playing with Lego or something which can't have a right or wrong component. No I wouldn't do this with my adult clients!\nThirdly when they do trust me enough to start opening up, they don't have the vocabulary. I don't mean they don't know words. Of course they do but finding the words to express their feelings, feelings they can hardly understand, is almost impossible. So we use indirect questioning techniques and a lot of 'clean language'. I find drama, music and art very useful and we also play with glove puppets, stones, Moshi Monsters and talk about cartoon characters.\nChildren are wonderful to work with. They are very different to working with adults and very rewarding. I don't train people who don't have children as all your homework is practical and has to be done with children or teenagers. But my students have without exception found that the training they have had from me has not only enabled them to confidently work with child clients but has also really improved the bond they have with their own children.\nYou can find out more about training with me on the What we offer page and use the drop down menu to find NLP Kids Practitioner Training. I am in the process of being accredited by the ANLP but I do offer a residential course lasting a week and based in my own home, if that suits you better than the 12 weekly Skype sessions."

And most of the time… we can’t say they’re entirely wrong. We’re probably the only industry in the world that people invent technologies to avoid.\nThe industry is increasingly questioning what brands actually add to people’s lives. A brand is more than a product. You can get rid of a product, but you can’t get rid of a brand (unless you have good lawyers).\nRecently, Hubert Reeves reminded us that we’re at a crossroads. The world doesn’t need more products. The saying less is more has never been more timely and relevant. We don’t need another product, we need better brands.\nWhat value are we adding when we use ads to help sell disposable products? What value are we adding when we refresh logos for products who really need to refresh their place in the world?\nWe all have the tendency to drink our own Kool-Aid and think consumers will be interested in our latest content pieces. But most people don’t have the time, interest or desire to engage with brand content. What actually interests them is how a brand can add value to their life.\nGiven that new, human-centered definition, some brands have the potential to make a difference in our world like never before, sometimes much faster and more effectively than our own governments.\nThese are the brands that truly care about the well-being of the people who consume them because they are aware of their social, cultural, environmental and political impact. These brands are finding new ways to be relevant, useful and entertaining. They are creating engaging ecosystems, based on experiences that welcome and nurture consumer relationships.\nWe need to recognize those brands more often and mirror their actions. To do so, I’m putting together a list of brands who, in my humble opinion, understand how to make a real difference in people’s lives.\nWarning: cheesy video alert. Nonetheless, they embedded good into the product."

        "text": "Can Medical Marijuana Actually Assist With Rough Hangovers?\nSpending a night out with your friends is always a good time, but the morning after is not always a bed of roses. Too often, going hard at the club or the bar will result in a massive headache and upset stomach the next day. However, what if there was a way to reduce the effects of a hangover? While there are plenty of products on the market today, one might be the best of them all: medical cannabis. Let’s see what discoveries are being made about this potential cure.\nBefore we can decide if weed can cure this ailment, we first have to understand how it works. After a hard night of drinking, your body requires two things to feel refreshed and get back to normal. First, you need to rehydrate as alcohol saps your body of water. Second, you have to flush all of the toxic chemicals out of your system. Until both of those things happen, you won’t be rid of your hangover.\nWell, it should be clear that smoking a joint will not rehydrate your cells, nor will it expunge the alcohol from your body. So why would it ever be considered a hangover cure? Well, two reasons. First, it helps you feel better, so you are not in as much pain (particularly in your head). Second, it can alleviate your nausea and help you eat and drink. Since water is necessary to beat your hangover, this can be a game changer.\nIf you want the ultimate in convenience, then you should look into getting your weed delivered. After a night of partying, you won’t have the energy or stamina to go to the nearest dispensary. Instead, look for marijuana delivery near me and hit them up for some sweet relief.\nOverall, weed won’t cure your hangover, but it will make it a lot more tolerable. The only thing to remember is to smoke a little bit; it’s never a good idea to be hungover and high.\nWhat Is the Connection Between Ethics and Social Media?"

Utilize this list to ensure these pitfalls are not limiting you.\n* What are your social networking web pages saying concerning you? Essentially every savvy company nowadays will certainly inspect your history on Facebook, My Area, Linked-In, perhaps even You Tube before making an employing decision. Don’t allow that spur-of-the minute article for buddies or family members years back, come back to haunt you. In short, if you wouldn’t want your employer to see it, delete it prior to the meeting!\n* Your resume has way too much personal “baggage.” Height, weight, age as well as marriage condition may have had some relevance years back, however these locations have no place in your resume today. In fact, present-day legislations limit outsider’s accessibility to a lot of this personal information, so why volunteer it? Similarly race, religion, even statements regarding entertainment activities are rarely (if ever) appropriate to work and are can antagonize you. The stating: “If in doubt – leave it out,” applies.\n* Keep it truthful – Essentially every little thing you include in your resume can (as well as will certainly) be cross-checked for precision so don’t also think about hedging in this area. Make clear any type of areas which require explanation (such as gaps in employment, unexpected work departures etc.) Again, without being intentionally misleading, always cast such problems in a favorable light.\n* View your language – Not only maintain your speech “tidy” in the meeting yet be cautious exactly how you depict former managers and associates. Trashing your former work (also if you feel it is justified) will certainly never ever help you obtain a brand-new work as well as, more often, will certainly better restrict your possibilities of being worked with.\n* Struck the ground running – If the business offers you a setting requiring new skills, be prepared to discuss why you have the ability to launch with minimal training as well as modification. The candidate that agrees as well as prepared to go to work right now, will always obtain the task over anyone else.\n* Believe long-lasting – You’re not the only one that would certainly like a veteran task. The job interviewer doesn’t wish to have to replace you within a few years either so make certain to be all set to discuss where you want to be with this firm, say 5 or ten years in the future. (If your future doesn’t consist of the business where you’re speaking with, never mind using as you won’t be employed).\n* Be specific – a job meeting is no location to talk in generalities. Your boss is paying for results not “pie in the sky” pledges, so utilize the interview to make clear what you have actually performed in previous positions and also what you prepare to do when worked with. Information details reasons that they need to hire YOU, and also not one of the lots of other candidates."

        "text": "A lot has transpired in the world over the past couple of weeks. Rapper/Community Advocate Nipsey Hussle was gunned down in his neighborhood which left our culture and the Hip Hop world in complete disarray. There’s a lot to be said about his demise, the impact/legacy his life will have on our society and Hip Hop going forward, and how we can play our part in this paradigm shift - but right now we desperately need to fill up on some SOUL FOOD. There are so many things sucking the life out of us at this moment. News reports, social media posts, and a whole lot of chatter has us going in various directions mentally. We all need to take a step back and fill up.\nA couple of weeks ago I wrote about feeding yourself constantly. With all that’s going on and all there is to come, I want to hone in on that topic and share some things that I believe are good TO and FOR your soul. I’m sure a lot of you may do some (if not all) of these things already. - you just probably don’t refer to it as “feeding your soul.” But anything that feels good to you and doesn’t hurt you or anyone in the process is feeding your soul. Get into my tips below.\nLaugh and hold a good conversation with a loved one - There’s nothing like kicking your feet up and reminiscing with a friend about the crazy things you guys used to do in the past, or sharing your dreams with a person who has your best interest at heart, or laughing until your stomach hurts with a family member. Moments like these reboot your love meter and give you the release you so desperately need every now and then.\nRead or listen to some inspiring words - You don’t have to open a book to read some inspiring words (although I recommend you do). Now days you can google a certain motivational topic or click on your YouTube app to hear some inspiring words. This has everything to do with monitoring what you monitor. You have to watch what you are letting seep into your psyche. The more you ingest empowering information, the more soulFULL you will be.\nGive out flowers - No you don’t have to go to the plant store to do this one. I’m referring to speaking words of beauty to your loved ones or strangers. If you feel someone is doing a good job, let them know you’re proud. You think that guy has on some cool shoes? Tell him! You like her hair? Compliment her! The world can be so harsh, and your words and gestures can help heal it. Giving out flowers metaphorically is gratifying and therapeutic. Putting beautiful phrases and words in the atmosphere creates some good energy which eventually comes back to you.\nLook for the good in every situation - The Kirk Franklin song, Blessing in the Storm has a whole lot of truth to it. When you’re looking for the good and the blessing in every situation, you’ll find it. Sometimes the blessing is harder to find than other times, but it’s there. When you operate with this type of mentality, burdens won’t look the same as they did before - and as a result, your soul will eventually become lighter and lighter.\nEat a good meal AND some dessert - Don’t go overboard with food, but don’t deprive yourself either. Have a good meal and some dessert every now and then. We are often eating on the go and trying to fit a crappy meal in wherever we can. Every once in a while sit down and truly enjoy a full course meal. Then get under your comfortable blanket, turn on your favorite TV show, and savor that piece of chocolate cake. Life is short, treat yourself here and there - your soul definitely smiles when you do.\nWatch a movie that makes you feel good - No horror movies or mind boggling dramas….watch a movie that makes you tingle inside like Love Jones or that makes you fall out on the floor laughing like Bad Boys (yup, I’m stuck in the 90’s). It doesn’t matter if you’ve seen it 100 times already…souls love familiarity.\nJam out to some good music - Listen, a good Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, or Goodie Mob song will have me going to church! And don’t let some Frankie Beverly and Maze come on then I’m two-stepping all over my kitchen floor! You know that feeling you get when your jam comes on, and something compels you to close your eyes, tilt your head back, and let out a joyous groan? Yup, that’s your soul saying you’ve hit the spot! Whether it’s discovering new music or listening to that old faithful tune that you know pulls on your heart strings - you need it. Music gets us through hard times, helps us to celebrate happy times, and gives us hope for better days to come.\nConnect with nature - There’s nothing like rocking in an antique chair on a relic porch. There’s something spiritual and invigorating about it. Currently I don’t have a porch, so the other day I sat outside on the steps of a building for 10 minutes. I let the sun cover my face as I smiled at people strolling by. When I got up from the steps to go to my next destination, I felt satisfied. Being out in nature refreshes your soul. Connecting with the natural elements puts you in a better mood and soothes your mind. You don’t have to spend hours outside, just take a brief walk or sit outside for a second when the weather permits. You’ll surely reap the benefits.\nGive/Help someone - I once read a quote from Janelle Monáe that resonated with me. She said, “I’m a believer that the more I am giving, the happier I am, and the more beautiful my exterior will be.” Janelle ain’t lying ya’ll! Giving is medicine for the soul. It’s healing. To see someone’s face light up when you do an unexpected, good deed is an incredibly unmatched feeling. When you give, you’re not only benefiting that person or organization that you’re helping - you’re benefiting yourself as well.\nWhen we feed our souls, the world and everyone around us will benefit. Stay soulFULL my people."

I loved that he explained everything and was very honest about the severity of the surgery but he also armed us with the knowledge for the best possible outcome. My sons main concern was pain and Dr. Kelly explained to him that pain control was his top priority- And he did an excellent job!

These entities will generally use Forms 1094-B and 1095-B to report information about coverage they provided during the previous year. Section 6056 applies to applicable large employers (ALEs), or those with 50 or more full-time employees, including full-time equivalents, in the previous year.

The extended due dates are automatic, meaning employers are not required to submit any requests or documentation to the IRS to take advantage of these new deadlines. Any requests previously submitted will not receive formal approval from the IRS. Despite this delay, employers should not put off completing these forms.

Most of these women (men too) want their circumstances to be different, but they often don’t want to change their behavior that is contributing to their pain.\nWhat a good therapist is supposed to do is learn from their client’s history in relationships and help them identify their particular pattern. Focusing only on an isolated incident isn’t very effective because most people believe it is a one time occurrence caused by circumstances beyond their control.\nI began to notice that within my group there were many women who were involved with men who were alcoholics. Their stories were different and yet they all had an eerie pattern of familiarity. They found the men “exciting” and felt an instant “chemistry” and couldn’t understand how the same man could turn out to be so mean, insensitive and hurtful.\nI saw this pattern repeated so many times that I stopped counting.

The employment contract you provide should include working hours and how overtime will be handled.\nYour employees only need to work overtime if it is specified in their contract. If you need employees to work overtime, you should include compulsory overtime provisions in their terms and conditions.\nWhere your employees are required to work overtime as part of their contract, you’ll need to comply with The Working Time Regulations (WTR).\nThe WTR state that employees don’t have to work more than 48 hours per week, averaged over 17 weeks. Employees can choose to work more than 48 hours in a week, but they’ll need to have a written and signed agreement.\nVoluntary overtime is where you ask your employee to work overtime and they are free to say no. That’s because there’s no duty in the contract for you to offer overtime or for your employee to accept it.\nIn the case of non-guaranteed overtime, you don’t have to offer overtime but, if you do, your employee has to work because they’re bound by the terms of their contract.\nYou’re not legally obliged to pay your employees for overtime. However, you must ensure that your employees’ average pay for the total hours worked doesn’t go below the minimum wage.\nThe decision to pay for overtime is up to the employer. If you choose to pay overtime, you can also decide the rate, as long as it’s at or above the minimum wage. It’s important to note that you must stick to whatever overtime terms that you include in your employee's contract.\nThere have been some recent court judgments that you should consider when calculating holiday pay in relation to overtime.\nThe issues around holiday pay and overtime may become clearer as the Employment Appeal Tribunal is due to make its decision on a pending case.\nThey work more hours than the number stated in their contract.\nWork longer than the hours of full-time staff who would get paid overtime for working these extra hours.\nThe work is done during unsociable hours (late night work) that you would otherwise pay full-time staff an additional amount for."

We welcome back this wonderful neighborhood restaurant for the 2013 summer season in Provincetown.\ntheir own annual Memorial Day \"Pride Run\" on Commercial Street.\nDespite cloudy skies, drizzling rain and temperatures much lower than usual for Memorial Day weekend, Provincetown had a good-sized crowd of visitors in good spirits. People put up with occasional rain and a bit of a windchill factor and braved the stroll down breezy Commercial Street to pick up a new sweatshirt, jacket, poncho or umbrella, and continued finding pursuits other than beach activities. Others huddled indoors by a fireplace, waiting out the chilly weather. The storm clouds finally parted on Memorial Day afternoon, the last day of most peoples' three-day-weekend here, and the streets were filled with folks sporting shorts and tank tops and other summer clothing that had languished at the bottom of the suitcase since their arrival here.\nAs the sun began to shine steadily, a dozen or more kayaks were instantly put into the water, the first ones I'd seen this season, and the whole town took on the look of summer, with throngs of people on the streets shopping and sampling fried dough, clam rolls, shucked oysters and chowder. It finally felt like the summer was off and running. Street performers turned out in large numbers, a lot of them being new to Provincetown, while just a few of our summer regulars made an appearance.\nThe group pictured above started a tradition for this long weekend several years ago with a handful of friends coming to PTown to make their own symbolic \"Pride Run\" along Commercial Street. Over the years the group has grown, this year numbering 40 young women, along with the occasional odd gentleman, who have come to celebrate in a town where they are free to be themselves. Welcome to Provincetown, everyone!\nPTown Photo Ops Abound. Enter TheYearRounder's Photo Contest!\nTwilight brings the Pilgrim Monument to life as the lights come on.\nIf you just keep a camera handy, you can shoot some really great photographs all around Provincetown, with very little equipment, and with very little effort. When I started writing this blog I started carrying a camera with me every day. My cell phone camera (not the greatest because it is now several years old and woefully low on pixels) had to do for a few weeks until I could do a little quick research and get something a little beefier on eBay. I always buy technology at least a couple of generations back from whatever the current model is, because I seldom need all the bells and whistles found on the latest versions of cameras, computers, phones or whatever, and I usually need to save a bit of money on these items as well.\nI most often will shop online, since the closest big-box electronics stores or discount centers are 54 miles or more from Provincetown, and I gave up driving a car and churning out all that polution years ago. Shopping online also lets me buy something used or refurbished rather than new, which cuts down on resources used in manufacturing, and all that packaging used for new products, and saves the fuel used to ship truckloads of new merchandise all around the country each year, as I recently wrote in a column about reusing and recycling household items.\nGet a good camera inexpensively and carry it with you, and you can get great photos yourself. I wanted something digital with a lot of zoom and a good-sized screen so I could see what I was shooting, something to counteract jiggling the camera on those big zoom shots, and automatic operation with the ability to adjust settings manually as well. I wanted a camera that used batteries that I could recharge so I didn't have the guilt of tossing out hundreds of batteries over the years, but ones that I could also find at the drugstore in a pinch, and my \"new\" camera had to be small enough to carry around town with me wherever I went.\nI picked a couple of models that had all these features, looked up user reviews on Amazon, and from there I chose the camera model I wanted to shop for on eBay. I got a great deal on a used one, $88 including shipping, and I've been really amazed at the photos I've been getting with my Canon Powershot SX120 IS. The photo above, and most of the photos I've put on this blog, have been taken with this camera, and I really couldn't be happier with my choice.\nSo as I was walking along Commercial Street toward the center of town one evening, just as the twilight was about to give way to the night sky and the lights kicked on at the Pilgrim Monument, I saw this image rising above the rooftops a bit west of Town Hall. I got out my trusty camera and managed to get a couple of shots before the light changed. This photo turned out really well, with a lot of detail in the granite blocks of the monument, and the sky not yet dark.\nSend me your digital photos in jpg or gif format and I'll post the best of them here. Even a cheap \"throwaway\" camera can capture a great photo. Just don't forget to recycle the camera when you're done instead of throwing it away, which most developers will do for you, and then scan the photos into digital files to enter them in this contest. Email address and contact info is shown above. By entering this contest you grant your permission to have your photos published on TheYearRounder's Guide to Provincetown, with proper credit listing your name. Tell us a little about your photos, too. Only jpg or gif images can be entered. Photos shot on film can be converted to digital files at Provincetown Copy Canter, above Ross' Grill in the Whalers Wharf, at 237 Commercial Street, or at the Mail Spot, in the lane that leads to Sage, at 336 Commercial Street.\nThe best original photos taken somewhere in Provincetown, and received digitally by noon on Labor Day, September 2, 2013, will win prizes from local shops and restaurants. TheYearRounder's selections will be final. Happy shooting!\nPoppy Champlin, at the P.O.\nComic Poppy Champlin is a perennial Provincetown favorite with a very quick wit and a lot of audience interaction.

The comic genius of Russ King is embodied in a character whose bio centers around her win in a midwestern beauty pageant some 3 decades ago. Miss Richfield 1981 has made numerous television appearances and performed to sold out crowds all around the country. Her act is among the funniest things ever to land in Provincetown, with hair, makeup and wardrobe that could easily have been created by Earl Scheib., another legendary figure from the 80s. Catch this unforgettable show at the Crown & Anchor at 8 PM on Saturday and Sunday. Ticket info at 508 487-1430 or at the box office, 247 Commercial Street.\nBoston-based comedy, theater and dance troupe All The Kings Men have played to standing ovations at sold-out performances from Los Angeles to London, gleefully stepping over the boundary line between the sexes with an average of thirty or so gender-bending characters in each show. They've won numerous awards for their sketches, vignettes and characters whose stories range from the poignant to the preposterous. The troupe appears at the Crown & Anchor Friday, Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 PM.\nIllusions is probably the longest-running drag show in Provincetown, and you'll see why if you catch them this weekend at the Crown & Anchor, Saturday and Sunday at 10 PM.

Find him at the Central House, at the Crown & Anchor complex at 247 Commercial Street, starting at 9:30 PM on Saturday, with no cover charge.\nBen offers us a taste of the deep-fried calamari and the pulled pork enchilada.\nEl Mundo, starting their 3rd season here, brings their take on Mexican cuisine to PTown, and I am personally grateful. I stopped in the other night for their opening party where well-wishers were treated to tastes from all corners of El Mundo's menu, like tortilla chips with a spicy black bean & chipotle dip, pulled pork enchiladas (the mole gives it just a little sweetness) and their very tasty barbecued shrimp on a skewer. There was a cheviche made with squid and octopus. Their wonderful green chili enchilada (vegetarian, stuffed with jack cheese, spinach, corn-off-the-cob and poblano chilies) is one of my favorite dishes here, and I was happy to find it at the party as well. The crispy, lightly battered calamari was especially good. I hope it turns up as a special periodically because it isn't on the regular menu.\nI'll be here often this summer for favorite seafood dishes like the fish tacos and the shrimp and goat cheese burrito. as well as more traditional choices like Carnitas (slow roasted pork,) soft or crispy tacos, black beans, rice and a variety of homemade salsas and hot sauces. Their Smokey Chipotle and their Red Hot Mama (habañero) sauces are now available to take home, too, to help us get through the long winters when El Mundo closes up for the season.\nMy favorite dish from their 1st season wasn't on the menu last year, and I lobbied hard to get it back. Bea tells me the fabulous pan-fried oysters will indeed be back on the menu this year. With a unique flavor, a little spice and a bit of a crunch, there's nothing like them anywhere else in Provincetown.\nEl Mundo has a full bar serving several Mexican beers, craft beers and specialty cocktails, including a dozen different margaritas. They stock 22 different tequilas, including four aged varieties, so they take their margaritas pretty seriously. And even dessert is done with a Mexican twist. The Pot du Creme is a dense, smooth sort of dark chocolate mousse with a bit of chili to give it a little kick. Delish!\nEl Mundo has two dining rooms, one with a water view and one with a view of bustling Commercial Street. Outdoor seating looks out over the beach and the harbor. Service is good, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed. Prices are reasonable, too. Last August I wrote about the lunch special in a blog post about inexpensive, great food in Provincetown. Click on this link to read that post and to find three great meals for under $35 for the day. I hope they bring their lunch special back this summer. Last year it won TheYearRounder's Best Bite award for outstanding value for a great meal.\nYou'll find El Mundo at 269 Commercial Street, right across from Town Hall. We miss them over the winter, and we're happy to welcome back Bea and Shelby and the gang for their 3rd season.\ntrains finally began steaming all the way down the Cape to Provincetown in 1873.\nWhere Harry Kemp Way meets Howland Street you'll find a conservation, public park and recreation area with a nature trail that will lead you out through the woods toward the water tank found on Mount Gilboa.\nThe combined efforts of a number of local people and PTown organizations led to the establishment of this beautiful public recreation spot back in 1995. The trail follows the old railroad bed established by the Old Colony Railroad when train travel to Provincetown finally became possible. Railroad service from Boston to Hyannis began around the middle 1850s, but it was many more years before trains would run all the way to the tip of the Cape.\nOur thanks to those who worked to preserve this wild space.\nOn July 23rd, 1873, a brass band heralded the arrival of the first trainload of dignitaries to make the journey. Before the advent of new railroad service to Provincetown, visitors had to rumble here by stagecoach, no mean feat given the long, rough ride from Boston. With the new railroad in place, it also became much quicker, easier and cheaper for Provincetown's fishermen to ship seafood, even to distant markets. At one time, our fishing fleet provided the majority of all frozen fish consumed in the midwest. Passenger service stopped in 1938, but freight cars still made the trip until 1960, when the railroad tracks in the area of North Eastham were abandoned.\nWildlife abounds on this trail, with all kinds of birds and plant life flourishing along the former railroad bed. At this time of year you'll find the lady slippers beginning to bloom along the edges of the trail. Whether you walk it's full length or just a short distance on this path, you're in for a lovely stroll through this beautiful conservation area.\nLocation:Provincetown, MA USA Old Colony Nature Pathway, Howland Street/Harry Kemp Way.\nThe Outer Cape Chorale offers free concerts Friday, Saturday and Sunday in PTown and Orleans.\nFrom Bach to The Beatles, from Gilbert & Sullivan to Joni Mitchell, the Outer Cape Chorale has been delighting Cape Cod audiences with some of the world's best-loved music since its inception in 2002. Conductor and Musical Director Jon Arterton gathered a group of friends together that winter and hatched the idea for a true community chorus, bringing together both trained singers and those who had never sung a note, creating a unique, truly remarkable choir that currently numbers some 140 voices from towns all over the Cape.\nThe Chamber Singers are a group of roughly twenty members of the chorus who will also perform several numbers in this concert featuring contemporary works by living American composers. The Outer Cape Chorale has been joined by pianist John Thomas and many other musicians over the years, performing for standing-room-only crowds all over Cape Cod. In fact, many choir members and musicians must travel to Provincetown from their homes in all corners of the Cape several times, for rehearsals as well as performances, making each of these concerts a true labor of love.\nTo make their music accessible to as many people as possible, the group will perform free of charge at Town Hall in Provincetown at 7 PM on Friday and Saturday, and at Nauset Middle School in Orleans at 3 PM on Sunday. To learn more about the chorus, to join their email list, or to make a contribution, click on this link to The Outer Cape Chorale.\nThis concert is always one of the most highly anticipated events of the spring, and it is definitely not to be missed. You'll want to arrive a few minutes early to make sure you get a seat. See you there!\nThe Red Inn remains one of the Cape's most charming restaurants.\nThese last couple of weeks there have been opening days at a number of restaurants all over town, and at many of these, opening parties with hors d'oeuvres and tidbits, and samples from their menus. I call it hors d'oeuvre season. It's a great time to wander the town and taste signature dishes or new offerings for the coming season in some of our favorite restaurants, or to become familiar with a new spot as the doors open for the first time ever. Watch for upcoming posts about the new Brazilian flavors at the Aquarium Marketplace, as well as the great new coffee shop right next to Town Hall, both mentioned briefly below.\nEach year, one of the town's most anticipated \"opening\" parties is held at the Red Inn, found at 15 Commercial Street, in the Far West End of Provincetown. The deck that runs the length of the inn looks out over spectacular Provincetown Harbor, which creates the perfect backdrop for the traditional spring gathering at this charming, romantic inn on the edge of the beach. At these opening events we all get a chance to converse with old friends we haven't seen since the end of the last season, we sample some remarkable food, and at the Red Inn's party there's always music and the chance to spin around the dance floor with friends old and new.\nAs usual, well-wishers were wowed by the constant cavalcade of comestibles coming out of the kitchen all evening. The waitstaff deftly swirled through the crowd with tidbits, appetizers, platters of oysters on the half-shell, filet mignon, and other favorites such as the Red Inn's famous herbed lamb chops. One of the best tastes of the evening was the mascarpone grits topped with Cajun crawfish. This luscious, creamy, slightly spicy side dish will be on the dinner menu this summer, served alongside a lightly blackened rainbow trout. It's sure to be a Townie Favorite.\nFurther along Commercial Street, at number 99, Sal's Place has reopened for their 51st season, serving Italian food (the real thing,) dreamy desserts (including homemade selections from Lora's own recipes) and there's a wine bar with varieties from around the world, many of them available by the glass, and some special menu items and bargains as well. All this and more, and that fabulous view, right on the edge of the harbor. Always a great opening party, with a stunning spread served banquet style for the whole community. It's coming up on May 22nd. See you there.\nattire to Saki's opening and some dressed up for the occasion.\nAnother happening spot this week on Commercial Street was Saki, in the center of town, serving up trays of sushi and other Asian delights to a throng of elated Townies. Skewers of beef satay, morsels of their candied chicken, and the stellar sweet potato roll (my favorite, seasoned perfectly and rolled up with crispy tempura crumb) were just a few of the tasty offerings at their opening.\nAlso now open for the 2013 season are a number of casual spots near the center of town, some with walk-up counters, some that are sit-down restaurants, and all are favorites in one way or another. I've written recently about The Coffee Pot and their ever-growing menu of homemade specialties, and the Portuguese Bakery, home of the best fried dough in town, hands down. Read about one of my all-time favorite meals, at Native Cape Cod Seafood, now open in the Aquarium Marketplace. The Fortune Cookie is open, and I can't wait to have the scallion pancakes, the Thai chicken wings and other favorites we've missed so much over the winter. Connie's Bakery is open, too, with some big changes, but I think you're going to like them. More about that excitement soon, along with an update on Uma Loucura, the new Brazillian spot serving a great stew of black beans and turkey sausage, and other flavors new to PTown. The Aqua Bar has reopened, with Dante and Ronna serving cold beers and specialty cocktails on the deck at the edge of the harbor.\nI had my first steamers for the season the other night at the Mayflower Café, and if you click the link you'll find the post I wrote about them last September. I visited John's Footlong for their terrific fish sandwich, still one of the best deals in town. Click this link to read my October post about John's lobster roll.\nI stopped by Blondie's new digs at 214 Commercial Street last week as they were putting the finishing touches on their new dining room (YAY!) and they promised their same menu would be available, but now with a full bar as well. I'll write about them as soon as I can get there for a meal.\nI tasted their fabulous herbed pork, and can't wait to try the sandwich that will feature it. Fresh baked goods and excellent coffee there as well. More on this spot soon.\nThe Red Shack is back, and the neighborhood rejoices!\nAnd that brings us to The Red Shack, across from the Chamber of Commerce at Lopes Square. Lunch and supper for now, but soon breakfast, too, and hours will go longer into the evening. They serve a little of everything: pizza, sandwiches, soups, dogs, and lobster rolls served half-a-dozen different ways. All are served with a quarter-pound of fresh lobster. The Mexican adds cilantro, lettuce, tomato and salsa. Try the Moroccan, with curry, mint, pineapple and a touch of mayo. The Californian adds lettuce, tomato, bacon and avocado. All of these are served on a Portuguese roll, and all of their breads are baked fresh each morning at the Portuguese Bakery, right around the corner. You can't get any fresher than that.\nMylan and Pamela will be whipping up some daily specials as well. My mouth still waters when I think about the roast pork sandwich they made me last autumn. Mylan spent time working as a personal chef while living in California, and cooked for various country clubs as well, and it shows in the quality and imagination in the food served at The Red Shack.\nWe welcome back all of these great PTown eateries, with more to come in the weeks ahead."

        "text": "Lots more patterns today. Many of the patterns boil down to the server-client relationship. Let’s say you have a laser scanner object that can scan a bar code and identify a product. There’s also going to be a sale object which gets a message from the scanner and then does some sort of sale stuff. Well now the scanner has to have code that knows about the sale and the sale might even have code that depends on the scanner. This system is now tightly coupled. But if you stick and interface between them, you can have them both know about the interface and not each other. Therefore swapping out the scanner for another one doesn’t affect the sale code. And changes to the sale don’t affect the scanner object. Patterns can be way oversimplified as the proper placement of interfaces. Too many and you’ve got needless complexity. Too few and the code is tightly coupled and hard to maintain. All these patterns have trade-offs so the big deal is not just knowing how to use them, but being able to figure out if they’re necessary/will help your project.\nMy project for the afternoon was, of course, banging my head against the Linux box. Apache keeps insisting that I don’t have permission to run the install.php program, but everybody has permission to use it. Hmm. At least Micah had some trouble when he tried to figure it out. I’m always a wee bit worried that the thing that’s been bugging me for days is only 30 seconds worth of work for a pro. So I went back to prowling through the httpd.conf file (a set-up file for the apache file server) for things to change or adjust. The day ended with Micah and me pretty stumped.\nThe big message I took away from Object Mentor that summer was that although patterns are cool and can help a lot, they add complexity. It’s a complexity/coupling trade-off. A message that has stayed with me. Just today I was looking at some code that could have been refactored to be more DRY, but way less intentional and I had to make a call as to wether the project would be better served by adhering to one principle or another. That’s the thing about writing code that is meant to be understood by humans: The hard part is not learning the language, patterns, or principles, but knowing when to use them and where."

        "text": "Menopause signifies the natural ending of a woman’s menstruation. With it, there are many symptoms, including fatigue and hot flashes. However, there are essential oils for menopause that may help during this phase of life.\nMenopause is defined by 12 consecutive months passed without a menstrual period. The majority of women experience menopause during their 40s and 50s; however, it is not unheard of for some women in their 30s to experience menopause. The symptoms that come with menopause can be uncomfortable, so many women look for quick, safe relief.\nWhile there are different treatments for menopausal symptoms, including hormone replacement therapy and low dose antidepressants, many traditional measures can come with strong side effects. For those who want a more natural way to relieve symptoms of menopause, essential oils are an option.\nThere are a number of different options to choose from if you want to try essential oils for menopause. Not all will be effective for every person, so it is often a case of trying a few different ones before finding something that works best for you.\nThis is one of the best essential oils for hormone balance. It has natural properties that can stimulate the effects of estrogen, which can impact menopause symptoms. It is also one of the recommended essential oils for menopause anxiety since it is known to help lower cortisol production and help fight weight gain.\nIt helps minimize stress, which can help a person with menopause get a good sleep. It can also reduce pain associated with headaches during menopause.\nA popular essential oil, peppermint oil is energizing, so it can help with the fatigue associated with menopause. It is said to calm headaches and nausea as well.\nAnother well-known essential oil that has undergone extensive study. Lavender has been known to help women who experience night sweats and insomnia. It is also considered a viable choice if you are going through menopause and feel your heart racing, which is a sign of early menopause for some women.\nThis essential oil has been helpful in reducing hot flashes, as well as relaxing tense muscles. The oil also has the ability to reduce fluid retention, swelling, and bloating.\nIf you have problems with concentration during menopause, basil essential oil may be helpful. It has been shown to improve focus as well as assist with physical fatigue.\nThis essential oil has hormone-balancing compounds. It also calms fragile nerves and improves memory. Those who experience cramps during final menstrual cycles can turn to thyme for pain relief.\nThis is another essential oil that can help with night sweats and hot flashes. Many women report that it hydrates dry skin and helps balance their emotions. Often people use this oil in a diffuser.\nJust like geranium essential oil, Ylang Ylang is known to help with emotions. It is really fragrant oil, so many women use it in bath and body recipes. When used in a bath, it is known to help improve circulation.\nThis oil has a refreshing impact on people from both a physical and mental perspective. In the case of menopause, lemon essential oil helps improve concentration and alertness when those periods of brain fog and fatigue hit.\nIf you are interested in trying essential oils for menopause relief, it is a good idea to do so under the supervision of someone who is an expert in aromatherapy.\nHow to use essential oils for menopause?\nEssential oils are concentrated extracts, so usually, all you need is just a few drops to experience a healing effect. Some people take five or six drops of a particular oil and mix it into one tablespoon of unscented lotion or carrier oil. Carrier oils are usually made of nuts, fruits, or vegetables, such as almond oil, olive oil, or avocado oil.\nInhalation: Electric diffusers are very popular for inhaling essential oils. The alternative is to put a few drops of the oil on a handkerchief or cotton ball and inhale when menopause symptoms appear.\nRoom spray: Add one or two drops of the oil to a spray bottle along with one ounce of vodka to disperse the oil. Avoid spraying wood, as it could create stains.\nMassage/bath: Mix eight drops of essential oil with one tablespoon of carrier oil and then add it to a warm bath.\nMilk bath: Mix eight drops of the oil in half a cup of milk or cream and then add the mixture to a hot bath.\nAlthough essential oils are natural, you do need to use them with care. They can be harmful in the wrong formulation and dosage, which is why it is best to use them when guided by someone who is knowledgeable about essential oils.\nDiscuss essentials oils with your doctor first to make sure the oil will not affect any medications you are taking.\nWhen thinking about essential oils for menopause relief, it can be hard to decide what to start with. There are many different recipes to help address the symptoms of menopause. Here are a few to think about.\nWorking with essential oils can be fun—mainly because you discover some amazing scents and can feel better at the same time. While not every woman experiences all the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, swelling, headaches, heart palpitations, or aches and pain, it is nice to know that there is a natural remedy for addressing any discomfort associated with menopause.\nResearch does suggest that 9 out of 10 American women going through menopause suffer from either mild or severe hot flashes. If you are in this group, discuss essential oils with a doctor and an aromatherapy expert. You just might find that essential oils will bring you the relief you’ve been hoping for."

I only get one or two at that time of the month, my pores are shrinking and my scars are fading.\nI love this comment! You’ve said it all and thanks for the tips.\nI loved this sweety:) you are a brave girl!\nThis is such an eye opener to so many. Trust me so many really don’t know what is causing acne!\nOf course, water is the best way to get that skin glowing and healthy.\nThis post really got my attention! Lol! My sis has terrible acne right now that anything about it gets my attention. So far nothing seems to work and the option of going out without foundation is impossible! Yes, her face is that bad ?. The only thing that seems to help a bit is when she juices (Mean green – cucumber, kale, ginger, lime, celery and apple) at least once a day, the acne stop but the black patches are still a huge problem! She works out five times a week, so she already has a very active lifestyle.\nI think that acne treatment is like trying to lose weight, it is not a quick fix but a lifestyle change. Any advise on clearing black spots?\nHi Miriam, so lovely of you to visit my blog and leave me comment. It’s been a minute! Hope you’re well?\nI remember your gorgeous sisters -light skinned beauties – acne on light skin is toughER truly. It’s great that she’s already active so maybe she needs to be on medication for no longer than 3 months to stop the bacteria? Just a suggestion.\nThere are spot remover creams that can be applied directly on the spots to lighten them but if that’s not an option then honey & fresh lemon juice is a natural way to lighten spots. The thing about acne scarring is to consider your body/skin type in general with regards to previous scars. Does she scar easily ? Do the scars clear fast? If yes then she should be patient with the acne spots, if no then it definitely means she has to actively work on it – spots remover cream or honey/lemon mix.\nGood Post… Skin is flawless yipee!!\nI’ve always been jealous of your skin/face… So fresh! This your care combo sounds like a winner!\nHello. I too never had acne till my late twenties when I used a sub-standard foundation without knowing and I had serious breakouts. I was so worried and I started using Clear Essence Medicated Soap for Acne and it did really work for me. I stuck with it and used it for about 1.5 yrs.\nFast forward to July 2015 and I used a facial towellete that had citrus and cucumber beads infused in it. Just 3 days of usuage and I broke out again. I did some research for the spots and I got the Fair and White Dark spot remover. It’s in a lil 30ml spray can. It is working too. Spots are clearing up.\nMy own case is def one of skin reactions. It ain’t fun really.\nHi Niz… Ive heard great things about the fair & white spot remover, do you know where I can find it?\nHello dear, this post has really made me happy. I have terrible acne like you and i was already thinking about bodyshops’s tea tree products. But what moisturiser do you use?\nHi Ronke… During the day I use olay cellucent White radiance, at night I use bodyshop tea tree blemish fade night lotion.\nHi S, thanks for this post. Picked up a lot of useful information.\nHad perfectly clear skin till recently and coming to terms with the fact that my skin is no more smooth has been rough. Tried everything, spent so much on products and nothing seemed to work.\nI do not think my diet was responsible. I suspect it started when i started caring for my hair and applying orisirishi to it. The oils must have seeped into my pillow cases and then moved to my face while asleep.\nBeen incorporating smoothies and exercise into my life and they have been helpful.\nSo thanks for confirming that I am on the right track.\nI’m glad you found this useful. My first dermatologist told me that pillow cases are a big culprit for acne aggravation especially when they’re not changed often. Even if you’re doing everything right but going back to lay on oil/bacteria infested cases, it’s like a rat race. So change them often & wipe your face with disposable napkins.\nWash makeup brushes often too.\nBody shop tea tree range is aah may zing…hmm hmm hmm..was my go to product but when the wrinkles started appearing (story of my life *sob sob*) I decided to look for something more..since then my life (and my face) has never been the same..someone at work uses namaste organics.. thinking of trying it too..but I like Chix’s mix…epp meeeee..lol..\nI’ve never heard of namaste organic until now, just googled it actually so I obviously can’t give any commentary on them.\nStumbled on your blog. I love it. And the fact you write on healthy lifestyle..Love it more!\nHmm, I had the mother of all acne 2013/2014 and it was as bad as yours,if not more. Diet also helped to keep it in check for a long time…I became obsessed with trying to clear my face through diet that I lost 10kg! it was a miserable period,I’d cry and cry not understanding why I had gravels on my face. Everyone had their product to recommend..my colleague even bought me POP..that ancient cream…Lol.\nAfter a while I discovered benzoyl peroxide and it reallyyy helped. Used to get the wash (clean and clear face washwith 10% BP) at Perfect trust then they ran out of stock,then Hmedix before they ran out as well. Now I use only my bathing soap and my face has been clear,smooth and glowy for a while now… I didn’t understand why till I realized God had answered my prayers .. I should testify in church. Lol. My diet isn’t even clean either… but you have inspired me again. One thing that also helped was drinking apple cider vinegar a generally healthy drink, I recommend it for everyone.\nI apologize for the epistle.\nCheers to even more smoother skins and complexions.\nHi Suga. Thank you so much! Comments like your truly make my day, very much appreciated.\nI used to use panoxyl too but soon realized topical aid can only do so much. It’s awesome that yours is okay now, and I totally get what you mean about but realizing when it’s cleared – our problems are all in the head sometimes. ACV sure does wonders, I use it myself mixed with lemon juice to drink and on the odd days, I use it as a cleanser with cotton wool.\nI’ve been avoiding reading this post, like a plague.\nI just recently noticed that Coke, my dear darling coke, my boo, causes me to break out now.\nS, see, I chose the breakout over a clear face, but, but, a time comes, in every ones’ life where we have to tell our selves the had truth.\nTea Tree for the win. All day, everyday.\nStarted using the St Ives scrub twice a week, then cleanse with my last remaining bottle of my Cucumber Freshening Water. (This bottle might last me a year).\nMight stop taking fizzy drinks from next week.\nYou’re doing everything right Hun, stick to it. I have an extra bottle of the cucumber water set, I’d save it for you.\nAh! the evil step-grandmother that is Acne. The PIH spots really annoy me as I am light-skinned and don’t use foundation or coverage beauty products because of the fear of clogging my pores.\nAnyway, I finally won the battle with acne this year, I used a Retin-A lotion for 6 weeks, the purging period was a little traumatic, but they all went away.\nFor “maintenance”, I make sure to deep cleanse with a mild astringent once a day, clean face = clear pores 🙂 Tea tree oil is a nice antiseptic.\nThe product that really surprised me was good ol’ Nixoderm. That cheapo product contains all the pimple zapping ingredients that you’ll find in the pricier products. I use this once a week as an exfoliant as it contains Salicylic acid.\nWhere did you get retin-A? A friend has been desperately looking for it.\nI purchased mine from Carlyle Pharmacy on Awolowo Road, Ikoyi. I’ve also seen it stocked at the Haven Pharmacy in CCD supermarket, Ogudu.\nCant really relate tho 🙂 but I know someone who will. guess I’m one of the lucky ones, I do nothing special to my face. Just recently I started using one of the Clinique facial washes just because…Future face needs to be on point.\nThis is a great post and I certainly appreciate your willingness to be vulnerable especially as I have a friend who has and is going through this.\nHey. This is exactly my journey. Well almost exactly. My triggers are stress though which as a working girl in the strenuous city of Lagos can be difficult to control. I just pray and when I realise I’m not breathing cuz I’m anxious I try to take controlled deep breaths. You have come a long way. Well done!\nI’m a guy of 21 years,fair skinned and face full of acne,I’m not really into beauty products but I’ve tried some soaps and lotions but still did not lead to anywhere,I just bought neutrogena facial cleansing bar and neo medrol couple of days,I really feel inspired looking at your pictures,hopefully it works for me.\nI’ve used both stuff you mentioned and while they helped in terms of managing flares, they didn’t clear my acne. I think you should just try and let’s see how you feel in a couple of weeks, cool ?\nPrior to this have you used anything else on the acne? Also how long have you had acne for?\nits me chuks,it turns out dear that the neutrogena cleansing bar and neo medrol just left my face fresh but didn’t remove the acne scars and spots,its really disheartening, right now I’ve just shreds of confidence left and find it difficult talking to someone face to face, I’ve had acne since when I was 16 ,I’ve used quite kojic acid soaps,usa black spot soaps,medicated soaps and I’ve used loads of over the counter products,I even went to spa but nothing worked,I decided to go natural,I ve been usin dudu osun and palmers skin success fade milk for my spots and scars for a month,pls do reply me.\nI’m sorry to hear yours isn’t getting better, I think you’re overloading your face with different products & that in itself can be aggravating. There aren’t any quick fixes with acne, you have to stick to a line or range of products and stick it out to see results.\nIn the meantime, I’d recommend you take it easy and let your face breathe; also, drink a lot of water and cut out processed junk foods & sugar from your regular diet. As For spots, carotene spots corrector helped me a lot so maybe you can try that as well.\nYes, the body shop blemish night lotion is really an amazing product, I use it myself. Unfortunately I don’t have access to it right now. Sorry I couldn’t be more helpful.\nI just came across your post out of curiosity and i’m glad i did. God bless you for this post.\nCame across your post by accident. You are so right. Diet, Exercise is Key. I have had acne, bacne everything. And I have to always maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen. I also drink the lemon juice every morning on the way to the gym. Thanks for being vulnerable and sharing. I may get those vitamins your mom gave you.\nYou’re welcome Grace. Thank you for reading.\nI’m putting together an updated acne regimen that has work wonders for me, and will share it on here soon so look out for that."

        "text": "Nature & Books belong to the eyes that see them.\nWe love our non-travel days! Back-to-back days on the road don't give us much of a chance to relax and enjoy our time at a campground or RV park. A non-travel day allows us to sleep late, enjoy our morning coffee, catch up on laundry, pick up some groceries (and maybe a DVD at Redbox) and, if time permits, do a little exploring. In a perfect world, we would stay at most of our sites for at least 3 or 4 nights, but with several destinations scheduled for this particular trip, we don't always have that luxury. Today we did.\nEnchanted Trails RV Park has a large, clean laundry room, so I was able to get a couple of loads washed before we headed out to run our errands. Albuquerque is a very large city, with two major freeway systems (I-40 and I-25) and very busy surface streets. Remember, we used to live in Lincoln, Nebraska and rarely had to get on the interstate. We now live on the Oregon coast and rarely get on any freeways, unless we have to travel in and about Portland. This country mouse isn't as comfortable on freeways as she once used to be in San Diego and especially not in a 26 foot RV. So, suffice it to say our \"quick\" trip to the grocery store was somewhat terrifying, especially when we had to merge on I-25 from I-40. Surface streets are the way to go!\nAfter our errands, we headed to Old Town and found a large parking lot with plenty of space for the RV. Always on the lookout for a good Mexican restaurant, we were happy to find Church Street Cafe, which had come recommended by my dad and stepmom. We had a delicious lunch and would definitely go back, if ever in the area again.\nIt was a long day and we were anxious to get back to the RV park and relax for a while before watching our movie. We took a walk around the park and checked out the vintage trailers (and cars), which are available to rent.\nWith our Passport America discount, we paid $18 per night, which is quite a bargain. The RV park isn't fancy, but it has a clean pool, laundry, showers and full hookups. There was a lot of road noise from I-40, but with the windows closed and our fan running, it's was just white noise. This was our first visit to Albuquerque and I'd love to go back and spend more time exploring the area.\nWhat cool cars and trailers! Bet you had fun looking at those. Also looked like some good Mexican food. We'll get to that area again at some point I imagine.\nKay, we thought the cars and trailers were very cool! If we didn't already have an RV to sleep in, we would've loved to have rented one of those trailers. Yep, very good Mexican food!\nThose vintage trailers and cars are awesome!\nKathy, we thought so, too!\nVery, very pretty. But I don't think I could do the highways and traffic. Even in our little state, they are too busy and full of crazy drivers. Not comfortable being on them.\nNan, I'm thankful that we don't have to travel on the larger highways and interstates very often. It would really put me off of this kind of travel if we did!\nNon travel days are the reason we travel, LOL!! The longer we travel, the longer we want to stay places. As you said, 3-4 days (or longer in really interesting places) feels just right.\nOh, how I love that area of New Mexico—especially Santa Fe and Taos. We haven't given Albuquerque enough time, but it's on the list. Great shots of the vintage trailers!\nLaurel, I'm hoping we get a lot of non-travel days in this year! I think we'll spend the spring and early summer months focusing on Oregon and Washington, so we won't have to drive quite as far, which will allow longer stays. Those vintage trailers were beautiful! I imagine they're nicely done on the inside, as well.\nI recognize some of this pics - especially the Santa Fe ones - love that town, as well as Old Town in Albuquerque. I used to work for a healthcare company headquartered in Albuquerque and visited many many times. Even went to the fabulous 2000 Balloon Fiesta. I do miss all those trips over a 6 year period.\nI do love traveling with you through these posts.\nI may not answer your comments in a timely fashion, but I always answer. Check back soon!\nIn the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.\nA day out-of-doors, someone I loved to talk with, a good book and some simple food and music—that would be rest.\nThe time to read is now, not hereafter. We must make time or miss our joy.\nhow did you spend your life?\nlying on the sofa reading.\nEstablished February 2006. Simple theme. Powered by Blogger."

        "text": "UN Poverty Envoy Slams Universal Credit and Sanctions Regime.\nThe UN envoy has issued this initial report on his visit to the UK.\nAlthough the various media stories just breaking underline the general issue of the poverty the UN envoy found one thing stands out: i the thread running through the report’s initial findings is the central role of Universal Credit in creating poverty and misery.\n14 million people, a fifth of the population, live in poverty. Four million of these are more than 50% below the poverty line,1 and 1.5 million are destitute, unable to afford basic essentials. The widely respected Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts a 7% rise in child poverty between 2015 and 2022, and various sources predict child poverty rates of as high as 40%. For almost one in every two children to be poor in twenty-first century Britain is not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one.\nBut the full picture of low-income well-being in the UK cannot be captured by statistics alone. Its manifestations are clear for all to see. The country’s most respected charitable groups, its leading think tanks, its parliamentary committees, independent authorities like the National Audit Office, and many others, have all drawn attention to the dramatic decline in the fortunes of the least well off in this country. But through it all, one actor has stubbornly resisted seeing the situation for what it is.\nThe Government has remained determinedly in a state of denial. Even while devolved authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are frantically trying to devise ways to ‘mitigate’, or in other words counteract, at least the worst features of the government’s benefits policy, Ministers insisted to me that all is well and running according to plan. Some tweaks to basic policy have reluctantly been made, but there has been a determined resistance to change in response to the many problems which so many people at all levels have brought to my attention.\nUniversal Credit and the other far-reaching changes to the role of government in supporting people in distress are almost always ‘sold’ as being part of an unavoidable program of fiscal ‘austerity’, needed to save the country from bankruptcy. In fact, however, the reforms have almost certainly cost the country far more than their proponents will admit.\nNo single programme embodies the combination of the benefits reforms and the promotion of austerity programs more than Universal Credit. Although in its initial conception it represented a potentially major improvement in the system, it is fast falling into Universal Discredit.\nThe Universal Credit system is designed with a five week delay between when people successfully file a claim and when they receive benefits. Research suggests that this “waiting period,” which actually often takes up to 12 weeks, pushes many who may already be in crisis into debt, rent arrears, and serious hardship, requiring them to sacrifice food or heat.10 Given the delay, which will only be partially mitigated by a recent concession, it is no surprise that the majority of claimants seek “advance payments,” which in turn must be repaid to DWP in relatively short order.\nAdditionally, debts to DWP and to third-parties can be deducted from already meager Universal Credit payments at a rate much higher than is the case with the older benefit system. While supposedly deductions are capped at a maximum rate of 40% of the standard allowance portion of the payment (which will change to 30% in a year’s time), the Government told me that in fact additional clawbacks can occur. These so-called “Last Resort Deductions” are for matters such as rent, gas, and electricity arrears, if it is judged to be in the best interest of a claimant or their household..\nAs I spoke with local authorities and the voluntary sector about their preparations for the future rollout of Universal Credit, I was struck by how much their mobilization resembled the sort of activity one might expect for an impending natural disaster or health epidemic.\nUniversal Credit has built a digital barrier that effectively obstructs many individuals’ access to their entitlements. Women, older people, people who do not speak English and the disabled are re likely to be unable to overcome this hurdle.\nArtificial Intelligence and Threats to Freedom.\nThe merging of six legacy benefits into one new Universal Credit system aimed at reaching millions of UK citizens is in fact a major automation project. The collection of data via the online application process and interactions with the online journal provide a clear stepping stone for further automation within DWP.\n“The United Kingdom’s impending exit from the European Union poses particular risks for people in poverty, but the government appears to be treating this as an afterthought,” said the UN’s expert on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, at the end of a 12-day visit to the country.\nA Budget for the Top 10% Wealthy, as 3/4 of Welfare Cuts Remain.\nOne Man’s Advice has been Heeded.\nTory Budgets are odd things.\nA Chancellor of the Exchequer stands up and grins like a Cheshire cat, meaning that you can be sure that only fellow tubby cats are going to be happy with the announcements.\nIn this case the likes of Sir Philip Green(CBI and British Chamber of Commerce) and the Sir Arthur Daley (President, Federation of Small Businesses) are lapping it up.\nPhil Fleming, spokesperson for the Federation of Small Businesses, described it as “a brilliant Budget”.\nHe said: “It was the most enjoyable Budget speech I have ever listened to in my life.\nSchools, we are told, are going to get cash for ‘little extras’.\nMuch needed it is said, for the post-Brexit teaching programme on the reintroduction of farthings, groats, and measurements such as Els, Furlongs, and terms for the reform of local government, Wapentakes and Hides.\nThe rollout of Universal Credit is being delayed once more, with a new target date of December 2023 for all claimants to be transferred to the Government’s flagship new benefit. The announcement came as Chancellor Philip Hammond provided an additional £6.6 billion over the next six years to smooth the introduction of UC, which replaces a range of welfare payments. Mr Hammond revealed the Treasury would be giving £1bn over five years to the Department for Work and Pensions to help ease the transition to the controversial benefits system. He also said he was increasing the work allowance – the amount claimants can earn before Universal Credit begins to be withdrawn – by £1,000 a year, at a cost of £1.7bn annually.\n7am @resfoundation #Budget2018 analysis: three quarters of the £12bn of welfare cuts announced after the 2015 election remain government policy.\nUnprotected depts per capita real-terms budgets are set to be 3 per cent lower in 2023-24 than 2019-20.\nThe Chancellor set out a significant easing of austerity in a £55bn giveaway Budget yesterday that set out major increases in public service spending, tax cuts and a reversal of cuts to the generosity of Universal Credit. But the squeeze is set to continue for low and middle income families, the Resolution Foundation said today (Tuesday) in its overnight analysis of the Budget, How To Spend It.\nFaced with a total fiscal windfall of £73.8bn from the Office for Budget Responsibility over the forecast period, the Chancellor chose to use 75 per cent of it in a £55bn giveaway Budget. But while yesterday’s Budget represents a significant shift in overall direction of public spending, it does not spell the end of the squeeze – either for unprotected public services, or over ten million working age families in receipt of benefits.\nThe analysis shows that over three quarters of the £12bn of welfare cuts announced after the 2015 election remain government policy, despite the welcome £1.7bn boost to Work Allowances in Universal Credit.\nHalf of the welfare cuts that hit family budgets are yet to be rolled out – including a £1.5bn benefit freeze next April that will see a couple with children in the bottom half of the income distribution losing £200.\n84 per cent of the income tax cuts announced yesterday will go to the top half of the income distribution next year, rising to 89 per cent by the end of the parliament (2022-23) when almost half (45 per cent) will go to the top ten per cent of households alone.\nThe richest tenth of households are set to gain 14 times as much in cash terms next year from the income tax and benefits giveaways in the Budget as the poorest tenth of households (£410 vs £30).\nThe overall package of tax and benefit changes announced since 2015 will deliver an average gain of £390 for the richest fifth of households in 2023-24, compared to an average loss of £400 for the poorest fifth of households.\nOverall day-to-day departmental spending per capita is now set to rise by 4 per cent between this year and 2022-23, rather than fall by 4 per cent as previously planned.\nHowever, the promises of extra spending on the NHS, defence and international aid mean that unprotected departments will continue to see cuts in every year from 2020-21. Their per capita real-terms budgets are set to be 3 per cent lower in 2023-24 than 2019-20.\nIf allocated equally this would mean day-to-day spending cuts of 48, 52 and 77 per cent between 2009-10 and 2023-24 for the departments of Justice, Business and Transport respectively.\nDespite the slight upgrade in the OBR growth forecasts, GDP per capita is set to grow by 4.9 per cent between 2018 and 2023, compared with an IMF forecast of 5.5 per cent across the rest of the G7.\nReal average earnings are not set to return to their pre-crisis peak until the end of 2024 – representing an unprecedented 17-year pay downturn.\n“The Chancellor was able to navigate the near impossible task in his Budget of easing austerity, seeing debt fall and avoiding big tax rises, thanks to a £74bn fiscal windfall. He chose to spend the vast majority of this on the NHS, income tax cuts and a welcome boost to Universal Credit.\n“But while yesterday’s Budget represented a seismic shift in the government’s approach to the public finances, it spelt an easing rather than an end to austerity – particularly for low and middle income families.\n“The Chancellor made a very welcome £1.7bn commitment to Universal Credit, but has left intact three quarters of the benefit cuts announced following the 2015 general election. Meanwhile income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long term gains going to the top ten per cent of households. On public services the NHS saw a big spending boost ­– but unprotected departments still have further cuts penciled in.\n“This Budget was much easier for Philip Hammond than many expected. But there will be tougher choices for Chancellors in the years ahead. Brexit must be delivered smoothly, public spending will remain tight, and forecasts may not always be so rosy.\nFrankie may have faults but he sums it up.\nFor some very fathomable reasons Twitter, Facebook, and all the rest, are the favourite playgrounds of charlatans, cranks, nutters, and….the DWP.\nThis Blog is no great fan of Frank Field.\nFew are, outside of his pet tarantula and his hair shirt.\nBut he is still there, ferreting away at the Tory Mess that is Universal Credit.\nThe Tory government has been accused of “playing people for fools” with a “misleading” advert about Universal Credit .\nThe image on Twitter last week boasted the six-in-one benefit “mirrors the world of work” because it is paid monthly and “paid to you like wages”.\nBut Frank Field, chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, claimed these statements were misleading.\nThat is because many low-paid workers are given their wages weekly, not monthly, Mr Field said.\nUC is also paid to one representative of the household – not each person. Activists have warned this policy worsens domestic abuse.\nMr Field has now written to complain about the letter to UC programme director Neil Couling in the Department for Work and Pensions.\nMr Field claimed: “These so-called “facts” about Universal Credit are nothing of the kind."

They will also gleefully inform you that the risks in some cases far outweigh the potential, especially if they are among the more cautious investors in the industry. Those who have made their fortunes in real estate however will tell you that investing in real estate is worth every ounce of risk when you manage to work through the rough patches and find your way to real estate investing fortunes.\nCommercial real estate investing is a bit of a different animal than traditional residential real estate that many of us are more familiar or comfortable with. You will need to do a lot of research before jumping in with both feet with this particular sort of real estate investment. Commercial real estate investments can take on many forms. From strip malls and outright shopping malls to business and industrial complexes to sky scrapers and high rise condos you will find all manner of commercial real estate interests. Whether your interests lie in business or personal types of commercial real estate there are significant profits that stand to be made.\nUnfortunately, beginners often find the path to commercial real estate investing laden with thorns. You will need a massive contribution to fund your commercial real estate pursuits and it is probably best if you can find a group of investors in order to share some of the risks. Real estate, in and of itself, is a high-risk venture. Commercial real estate bears a little more of the risks in the beginning however once you're established and people, particularly investors, know your name you will find that path to real estate wealth is much easier obtained through commercial real estate, if you play your cards right than many other types of real estate investing."

        "text": "Not a day goes by when you don't receive an odd email, tweet, or Facebook update from a friend or acquaintance imploring you to click a link to see a funny cat video or learn about a hot stock tip. Unless you have a very unusual set of friends, it is unlikely that these are legitimate messages. How does this happen? How can you protect yourself from becoming a victim and becoming a source of spam messages for your friends?\nHow does the bad guy hack my account?\nPerhaps he blindly guessed your password. Historically, many people have had very weak passwords, but most services impose some strength checks on passwords these days. Or perhaps the service you were using was hacked and your password was released. If this was the case, you either have read about it in the news, or your service was required to notify you.\nBe careful to not get hooked!\nIt is more likely that you were phished. The bad guy tricked you into clicking on a link that you thought was legitimate but in fact led to a site or software owned by the bad guy. This is primarily a social attack. The email or tweet appears to be from your friend or your bank. Either the message was spoofed (not really sent by the bank or friend), or your friend has already been hacked, and the attacker is using a legitimate account to send you a message.\nIn the past 5 years, phishing attacks have escalated to more directed attacks called spear phishing. A basic phishing attack is not directed at all. It gets a bunch of email addresses and sends a generic message about their Bank of America account with no knowledge of whether their target has a Bank of America account or not. With spear phishing, the attacker knows something about you, so the message will be more personalized and believable. If the attacker knows you just applied for a loan with Citibank, he can send a message about your loan application, and you will be far more likely to open that link.\nWhat happens when I click on a bad link?\nIt is possible that the item you are tricked to click on is an executable or an infected word or pdf file. Perhaps it appears that your friend has sent you a MS Word document with the secrets of great riches. By opening that document, you are giving the bad guy the ability to execute code on your machine. That means he can install programs to use your machine later (e.g. to send spam to others) or to gather information from your machine (e.g. tracking your keystrokes to find other passwords and account numbers).\nSo never open documents, zip files, or executables sent to you when you are not expecting them. Legitimate companies do not send attachments. Most friends are not going to send your attachments either unless you are actively collaborating on something.\nIn the classic phishing attack, the link will take you to a web page that looks like the real login page for your bank. So you enter your username and password. The bad guy stores that away, logs in for you, and redirects you to the real bank site. Now the bad guy has your user name and password to login to your account at his convenience. In the case of social media sites, the bad guy may log in as you to propagate the attack to your friends.\nWhile having the bad guy get access to your facebook or twitter account may be embarrassing, it could be worse. Many people use the same password everywhere, and the bad guy knows that. He will be trying more interesting services like banks and credit card sites with the social media login information.\nAlways be cautious when clicking on links from emails, tweets and facebook. Most email, twitter, facebook, etc. clients will show the actual link as a pop up or at the bottom of the page. Many messages are formatted now to show user friendly names for links. So while the email says \"Bank of America Login\", the link may well be http://hackmenow.com instead of http://www.bankofamerica.com.\nThe Wombat Security Technologies group from Carnegie Mellon University has a game called Anti-Phishing Phil which trains you on identifying untrustworthy links. Check out the demo version.\nBe skeptical about whether an attractive email is legitimate. Do you have a relationship with the company in question? If Bank of America sends you an email saying they owe you $10,000, it is probably not legitimate particularly if you don't have an account with Bank of America. Or your Aunt Matilda is probably not going to be sending your links with opportunities to get rich via a hot stock tip.\nDo not share passwords between services. At least do not share passwords between services that have less critical information (e.g. Facebook) and those that have critical information (e.g., your bank). Getting hacked on Facebook is embarrassing. Getting hacked on your bank site can be bad for your financial future.\nI clicked on an unsavory link. What should I do now?\nThe attacks are getting better and more sophisticated. It is likely that at some point you will be tricked into entering your Facebook account information first thing in the morning. What do you do now?\nIf you downloaded and opened or executed a file (e.g. a pdf, exe, doc, or zip file), run a deep virus scan on your computer. If the scan doesn't reveal anything, don't be too relieved. If it is a new attack, it may not yet be characterized by the scanners. You may want to take your computer to a local computer service company to perform a deeper analysis. Do the scan even if you are running an Apple device. While Windows devices have the bad reputation, Apple devices are also vulnerable to attack, particularly if you execute the program for the attacker.\nIf you entered your password into a bogus site, change your password now. If you use the same password on other sites, change your passwords there as well. Don't wait for folks to tell your that you are sending odd emails. Do it now!\nIf your friends start reporting getting odd emails or tweets from you, assume you have been hacked and didn't realize it. Change your passwords for the service sending the odd messages and for any other services that share that password.\nGood luck out there! A little vigilance will keep your safe in your Internet travels."

        "text": "At a high level of abstraction, a digital or computer file is a stored segment or block of information that is available to a computer program. Files are so named because they are the counterparts of the paper documents traditionally kept in file folders, usually stored in a file cabinet. Computer operating systems consider files as a sequence of bytes, while application software interprets the binary data as, say, text characters, image pixels, or audio samples.\nThis term is comparable to the term file as defined in Introduction and Supporting Materials from PREMIS Data Dictionary (p. 7): \"A file is a named and ordered sequence of bytes that is known by an operating system. A file can be zero or more bytes and has a file format, access permissions, and file system characteristics such as size and last modification date . . . . Files can be read, written, and copied. Files have names and formats.\"\nAlthough this high-level meaning is valid for the Federal Agencies Digitization Initiative, our definition also calls attention to the digital file in relationship to the digital package and the digital package part. Take, for example, the case of a digitally reformatted book or 78 rpm phonodisc. The digital package includes all of the files pertaining to the digitized book or phonodisc. Most reformatting programs will create a set of versioned digital files--perhaps an archival master, a production master, and multiple derivative files--for each book page or disc side (digital item parts). Thus page 3 or side B may be represented by three or four files that meet a variety of objectives."

With a population of over 400,000 in the city itself and over 1.2 million in the metropolitan area, Toulouse is both the fourth-largest city and the fourth-largest metropolitan area in France, after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. Toulouse is perhaps most famous for its role in the French aeronautics industry: it is the site of the headquarters of airplane manufacturer Airbus and the Toulouse Space Center, one of two command centers for CNES (“the NASA of France”) and the largest aerospace facility in Europe. Not surprisingly, Toulouse is also a university town, with several technology schools and research centers, as well as the world-renowned University of Toulouse, one of the oldest universities in the world. With about 125,000 students in residence, Toulouse boasts the third largest student population in France after Paris and Lyon. Based on my personal experience during that short weekend visit, I can attest to the fact that you can’t swing a baguette in Toulouse without hitting a 19-year-old college student!\nThe history of Toulouse did not end in the 1200s, of course, but it was the end of Toulouse as a country independent of France. It’s also the period of the city’s rich history that was most evident (and most interesting) to me during my brief visit. For background on the more recent history of Toulouse, though, you can click here.\nA typical side street. See why it’s called “la ville rose”?\nThe Pont Neuf. Like the Pont Neuf in Paris, it is now the oldest bridge in town.\nAccess to Toulouse from Paris is easy. Air France operates several flights a day at very reasonable fares, and flight time is only about an hour. Transportation from the Toulouse-Blagnac Airport is quick and efficient on the regional bus/tram/subway system, Tisseo. You can get one-, two- or three-day passes at the airport to get into and around town during your stay. Once downtown, though, you’ll discover that the historic city center is quite walkable.\n← The dish ran away with the spoon.\nGreat Title Michael!!!

With the heat of summer behind us and the tundra of winter still ahead, there are a lot of things to do in the District and the weather is often cooperative. Here are some ideas of things to do before and after Quality Talks in Washington DC!\nDC is known for its national monuments and museums. Most are free to view or attend and with such a variety, there’s something for everyone. Located on the National Mall, you’ll find the city’s collection of Smithsonian museums including the National Museum of American History, National Museum of Natural History, National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of the American Indian, National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Gallery of Art. All of the museums are well worth your time, but you might want to pick one or two to prioritize depending on how long your stay is. Another popular museum in town, though not part of the Smithsonian Institute, is the Newseum. Located in close proximity to the National Mall, the Newseum explores history through the eyes of the press.\nMost of DC’s national monuments are also located near the National Mall and can be seen via foot or by one of the many bus or trolley tours offered. If you want to check out all of the monuments the tour is your best bet.\nThe Capitol Visitors Center opened in 2008 and is serves as the welcome center to our nation’s capitol building. While the Capitol is a working office building, it also serves as a national monument and is open to the public for tours. You can book a tour through the Capitol Visitor’s Center by visiting their website, or contact your congressional representative. While you are visiting the capitol, you can check out the Supreme Court and Library of Congress both of which are located near the Capitol complex.\nDC has an array of shopping experiences to choose from. From local neighborhood markets to larger, more commercial areas – there’s plenty of places to visit. Georgetown is home to about 500 shops and restaurants and is located near the Potomac River. It’s a historic neighborhood so you can enjoy views of quaint, historic homes nestled between shops. If you don’t want to venture to Georgetown, check out DC’s new CityCenter retail hub. DC’s newest shopping area, CityCenter boasts higher end brands such as Burberry, Louis Vuitton and Gucci. If you are looking for something more local, check out Union and Eastern Markets. With local food and retail vendors, both locations offer a more local feel.\nWant to explore the city further? Check out Washington.org’s “Discover DC in 360 degrees” for more information."

        "text": "There is actually a great deal of crossover between the two words and the items they represent, meaning the terms can be used interchangeably a lot of the time. This arises due to the different ways the words are used as nouns or verbs and, in relation to products such as screws, nails, nuts/bolts etc, difficulties arise unless the word ‘fixing’ is ONLY used as a verb.\nAs always, when there is confusion like this, the best place to head for is the dictionary to get a proper definition. But don’t worry, we have done the research for you!\nFor example, if a joist is securely nailed into a joist hanger, with the use of extra straps for lateral restraint purposes, ‘fixings’ refers to the entire system, inclusive of all straps and connectors. The ‘fasteners’ in this context are the nails. A further example: if a rafter is attached to a wall plate using nails, the ‘fastener’ would be the nails and the ‘fixing’ the nails centres.\nIn most cases, uses the terms interchangeably is not a major issue and you will generally be understood either way. Our original question, about why we are not called BS Fasteners, is that we supply such a wide range of products that it makes more sense to refer to the entire systems we supply rather than individual items. Also, BS Fixings rolls off the tongue much nicer in our opinion!\nWhatever you need to fix, use our fasteners to fix it. We have got everything you could ever require and, if you can’t see it right away, then our expert team will source it for you to ensure that your project can be completed to the most professional standard."

It will be joined by two further aircraft in 2010 to complete the flight testing of the AW159 and the wide range of role equipment the aircraft will carry.\nThe maiden flight of the AW159, which will be known as Lynx Wildcat in UK military service, marks a major milestone in the development of this new six-ton multi-role military helicopter, 62 of which have been ordered by the UK Ministry of Defence for the Army and Royal Navy, to perform both land and maritime missions. The first aircraft will be delivered in 2011 with the aircraft becoming fully operational with the Army in 2014 and the Royal Navy in 2015.\nThe British Army’s AW159 Lynx Wildcat will perform a wide range of tasks on the battlefield including reconnaissance, command and control, transportation of troops and materiel, and the provision of force protection. The Royal Navy variant will provide an agile maritime capability providing anti-surface warfare capability and force protection and will operate in support of amphibious operations and be an important element in defending ships against surface threats. There will be a high degree of commonality between the Army and Royal Navy helicopters that will mean that an aircraft can switch roles easily, principally through the changing of role equipment.\nThe AW159 is powered by two new generation CTS800 engines, each capable of continuously producing 1281 shp giving the aircraft exceptional hot and high performance. The aircraft has an all up mass of 5790 kg with a built in capability to increase that to 6250 kg. The cockpit includes a fully integrated display system utilising four 10x8 inch primary displays. Sensors include a nose mounted IR/TV imager with built in laser designator and for the maritime variant the Selex Galileo 7400E 360 degree active array radar. The AW159 also has a comprehensive integrated defensive aids suite comprising a missile warning system, radar warning receivers and a countermeasures dispensing system.\nAdditionally the AW159 will e capable of carrying a range of weapons including machine guns, torpedoes, depth charges and the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW). The AW159 programme for the UK MoD continues to be on time and on budget and was the first major project to be awarded under the Strategic Partnering Arrangement signed by the UK Ministry of Defence and AgustaWestland in June 2006. AgustaWestland has also signed partnering agreements with a number of key supplier on the AW159 programme including Selex Galileo, a Finmeccanica company; GKN Aerospace, LHTEC – a partnership between Rolls-Royce and Honeywell, General Dynamics UK, Thales UK and GE Aviation."

        "text": "Becoming a professional tightrope walker requires a combination of daring, desire for an adrenaline rush, fierce determination and nerves of steel. This isn't a job where you'll just start out at the top. You'll have to practice for years before you're scaling heights that grab the attention of professionals.\nTightrope, or tight-wire, walking is a career that involves training so much that your body begins to instinctively react to changing conditions, such as wind or slack in the rope, and you develop superb balance that keeps you on the wire no matter how conditions change. By starting to train when you're young, you can gain the skills and balance needed to get ahead of the competition and impress entertainment companies when you're looking for a job. Many circus-oriented camps offer summer programs that include training in tightrope walking. Future Stars offers a two-week circus arts camp for people up to age 16. Smirkus Camp offers summer camps for ages 5 to 18. The camp also can send residents to schools across the country to teach circus skills.\nFinding a mentor to train with is an important part of learning tightrope walking. Although you could theoretically learn from YouTube videos and the like, nothing beats one-on-one training. If you're too old for a summer camp, look for someone who works as a professional tightrope walker who might let you shadow him. Nik Wallenda, a famous tightrope walker, says his family has done tightrope walking for seven generations, and each generation mentors the new one. The job is dangerous, though, as two people in his family were killed from the walks and one person was paralyzed.\nWhen you're training, prepare for the absolute worst. Wallenda says that he trains under very difficult circumstances and if the weather or winds are worse than what he's trained for, he simply won't go out that day. Before tightrope walking in Chicago, he practiced 90 times walking on a wire blindfolded with wind turbines all around him. He also practices for falls and has even trained hanging from a wire for up to 40 minutes.\nThere's not a lot of information out there about the tightrope walking career or a typical salary. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't even have a listing for a tightrope walker. However, tightrope walkers either work independently, booking their own shows locally and then working their way up, or they work for an entertainment company such as a circus. Sometimes you can also find tightrope walking jobs listed on online job search sites.\nDaily Mail: Just Don't Look Down!\nDube, Stephanie. \"How to Become a Tightrope Walker.\" , https://careertrend.com/how-2063499-become-tightrope-walker.html. 05 July 2017."

        "text": "MEXICO CITY—Black Friday is the unofficial U.S. holiday that celebrates spending money.\nWe all know the hysteria-related headlines: People line up for TVs like they’re waiting for food rationings. Occasionally, riots break out. A few years ago, a shopper stampede even killed a Walmart worker.\nBut when it comes to recharging the economy, is it really that bad after all? We don’t want all our stores to meet Borders or Circuit City’s fate.\nTo foster spending during the “Buen Fin,” the Mexican government paid roughly 2 million employees half their “aguinaldo,” a Christmas bonus, early.\nI took in the “Buen Fin” in several spots around Mexico City. On Sunday, I visited a mall, which appeared slightly more crowded than usual. The stores offered unimpressive reductions – 15 percent seemed standard.\n“From what I’ve seen, there’s nothing extraordinary,” says shopper Jessica Santiago about the discounts. Nevertheless, she had an idea to spur more sales.\n“The should give everyone their ‘aguinaldo’ early. We don’t work for the government,” she says.\nAside from typical mall chains like Zara, the “Buen Fin” website listed a broad range of partners: chains selling mattresses, eyewear and auto parts; big box stores; car makers like Ford and Volkswagen; and banks also participated. I saw one, Banamex, offering three to six months interest free for purchases.\nOrganizers and stores talked-up the “Buen Fin” as if customers should feel civically obligated to shop: “Support the Mexican economy by joining #Elbuenfin” read one tweet from program coordinators. Given that tone, I wondered if the initiative had touched neighborhood shops in any way.\nSo shocker: Walmart receives the same complaints abroad. Also it should be noted: there are big box Mexican-founded operations.\nOne notable exception was La Ribera, an antiquated-looking Mexican footwear chain. A sign advertising 15 percent off in the entire store hung above the front door.\nA saleswoman told me that on Sunday, sales doubled compared with the normal haul. But the other days, business was as usual.\n“All of the days were decent,” she says.\nRuth Samuelson is a freelance journalist. She previously worked at Washington City Paper and her writing has also appeared in Global Post, The Washington Post, Fox News Latino, The Washingtonian, and the Houston Press."

        "text": "Amarr Emperors can expect to live for at least 500 years through the use of implants and other life-prolonging technology. Since the Amarrians believe royal flesh to be sacred, cloning it is seen as blasphemy and therefore strictly forbidden.\nThe emperor’s position is not hereditary. When the emperor dies, a new one must be selected from among the Five Heirs. The Five Heirs are the heads of the five royal families (the most powerful families in the Amarr Empire) and descendants of the original members of the Privy Council. The Council was a staunch supporter of the Emperor during the turbulent times known as the Moral Reforms, a struggle between the Emperor and the Council of Apostles which took place 1500 years ago. Since that time, although the Privy Council has today evolved into a fifteen-member council composed of representatives from the Empire’s various non-royal power blocs and institutions, it still represents, at its core, the five royal families vying for the throne.\nWhen the Emperor dies, an elaborate ritual for selecting a new Emperor is put into action. These rituals are performed in strict order and take a few weeks to complete. The rituals are always undergoing modification to better reflect the state of contemporary society and to fix problems encountered in earlier successor bids. The rituals mainly involve various ways in which the Five Heirs prove their loyalty to the Empire and their ability to run it. As should be expected, most of the rituals involve the Heirs directly, though some of them have changed through the ages to allow another person, chosen by the Heir, to perform in his or her place. In recent times, the successful selection of personal champions has been increasingly viewed as one of the strongest indicators of an Heir’s ability and prestige.\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of the succession process is that once a new Emperor has been chosen, the remaining four Heirs must commit ritual suicide. This is done to minimize the risk of conflict between the new Emperor and the old Privy Council; by removing all the old Heirs and replacing the Privy Council with those next in line within the five royal families, the slate is wiped clean.\nOnly twice has this tradition been broken since it first came into being more than a millennium ago. The first time was when Emperor Heideran VII of the Kador Family was selected just over 300 years ago. One of the remaining Heirs at the time was a young man named Khanid II, who had only recently become the head of his family. Khanid refused to uphold the ancient tradition and fled the royal court. In the vast regions of his family estate he founded a separate nation and called it the Khanid Kingdom. Needless to say the two states did not start off on good terms, and while their diplomatic history has seen its share of ups and downs, they are on good terms today. A minor new family, the Tash-Murkons, took the place of Khanid’s family in the royal court, and remains one of the five royal families to this day.\nThe second time the succession tradition was broken was in the year YC 110, when Jamyl Sarum – previously thought dead in the YC 105 ritual where her predecessor, Doriam, became Emperor – ascended to power in an Empire that had been floundering for over a year under the command of a ruthless and self-serving usurper named Dochuta Karsoth. Wielding an immensely powerful weapon of mysterious origin, Sarum stymied a massive invasion of the Minmatar into Amarr space and rode the wave of adulation directly to the Imperial throne, in the process sidestepping completely the traditions of imperial succession."

If your phone comes with an earphone, it will be cheap one which doesn’t have good sound. So in both cases, you need a new pair of earphones but doesn’t want to put a hole in your pocket. Don’t we will cover you on that as we are bringing you the list of best earphones under 500 Rs.\nIf you want the best pair of earphone for your smartphone then the SoundMagic ES11S is for you as it also has a built-in mic for calls. The design of the earphone is also different from other earphones in the same price bracket. It has rugged construction but fits comfortably in ears. The audio quality is overall balanced and could be your go-to earphones for your daily listening needs.\nThe MX 170 is the cheapest offering from Sennheiser. They are ergonomically designed and sits comfortably in your ears. For the price, they provide unmatched audio quality and also has a good bass. The earphones also have passive noise cancellation to eliminates the background noise.\nIf you want an earphone from a reputable brand which is also affordable the Philips SHE1405BK/94 is for you. These earphones have sturdy built quality and also has an inbuilt mic with a button. They are the best for the price range and in terms of sound, they offer a good and neutral sound. If you want heavy bass then these are not for you.\nThe Skullcandy JIB S2DUDZ-003 earphones are the funkiest looking earphones in the budget. They offer very good bass and loved by all the bass lovers. They have a long connecting wire and fits comfortably in ears. If you want the most stylish earphones then these are just for you.

These are very premium looking earphones under Rs500 with a metal built. They offer astonishing sound quality and the bass is too overpowered. The wire on the earphones is also tangle free and it also has a built-in mic which is a cherry on top. These are definitely the steal for the price and is the best earphone under 500 Rs.

Even though you try very hard, the progress you make is always little by little. It is not like going out in a shower in which you know when you get wet. In a fog, you do not know you are getting wet, but as you keep walking you get wet little by little. If your mind has ideas of progress, you may say, \"Oh, this pace is terrible!\" But actually it is not. When you get wet in a fog it is very difficult to dry yourself. So there is no need to worry about progress. It is like studying a foreign language; you cannot do it all of a sudden, but by repeating it over and over you will master it. This is the Soto way of practice. We can say either that we make progress little by little, or that we do not even expect to make progress.

        "text": "Cardamom also known as elaichi, has a wonderful aroma and an enticing warm, spicy-sweet flavour. The whole pods can be added to dishes, or the seeds can be extracted and either added whole or ground. When using cardamom to flavour curries, lightly crush the whole pod and it to the dish, and remember to use the whole pods for garnishing to add that dash of green. But remember to use it sparingly, as a little cardamom goes a long way.\nCombating Cold and Flu: If you are suffering from a flu, black cardamoms form the perfect soother. Just steep some pods in water with honey and it will relieve you effectively.\nAids Digestion: Its strong aroma helps in activating our taste and sensory elements, thereby aiding digestion. So, after a heavy meal keep some cardamoms by your side.\nMouth freshener: The floral and sweet aroma of cardamoms make it a natural breath freshener and helps promote oral hygiene.\nLowers high blood pressure: According to Ayurveda a concoction of a teaspoon coriander and one pinch of cardamom mixed with 1 cup of freshly squeezed peach juice can help bring down high blood pressure. Therefore, it is known to be a heart-friendly spice.\nSecret to good health: The Chinese believe drinking cardamom tea helps flushing out the toxins and keeps you healthy longer.\nSo, add a cardamom to your daily cup of tea, coffee, milk or a glass of warm water and honey, along with adding it to your sweet dishes and savoury ones alike, to make the most of this wonderful spice."

According to Xcel Energy, by the time 2012 is over, Minnesotans will have used about 1% less energy than they did in 2011, with its not-as-hot summer and tepid winter months.\nSo, how is this possible? According to an article on TwinCities.com, Minnesotans are not only becoming more energy conscious, but more pocketbook conscious in this time of economic downturn.\nPeople are making changes to their homes by using energy-efficient products, adding insulation, and adjusting thermostats. They’re also learning that doing these things save money in the long run, as does unplugging things not in use, not leaving lights on, and keeping heating and cooling system usage as low as possible.\nAccording to the same article, Xcel’s energy plants have actually been able to decrease their energy production by 6% per customer, which is a gigantic step in the right direction.\nTo read the full article, visit TwinCities.com."

Stroudsburg?\nI will be working with teachers across the border in Blairstown, NJ this week but I am staying in Stroudsburg. Where's the best grub?\nI am half tempted to drive to Scranton to get my Dunder Mifflin fix, but not sure an Instagram pic in front of Poor Richard's Pub is worth the 2 hour round trip.\nRe: OT: Best Food in Stroudsburg/E. Stroudsburg?\nStroudsburg is one of those nice old Victorian towns that hasn't had its downtown abandoned or gutted. East Stroudsburg doesn't have the charm of Stroudsburg. There are some decent local non-chain places but nothing stands out in my memory.\nPoor Richard's is a bust ... unless you bowl.\nGet some Pizza by Alfredo.\nSeruous note the seafood place from the show is pretty legit.\nI sent you a pers. message. Please check.\nI know years ago you could go to the Steamtown mall (now known as the Marketplace) and get your picture in front of the \"Scranton Welcomes You\" sign that they aired during the opening credits of \"The Office\".\nDepends on how badly you want that pic. The entire Scranton-Wilkes Barre area is a desolate place (IMHO). If you went to Scranton you'd probably realize it was a mistake. Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg are pretty nice. Are you working at The Blair Academy?\nDowntown Stroudsburg is your best bet most likely, it's definitely the more charming of the two town centers. East Stroudsburg is primarily residential and really functions as an extension of Stroudsburg as much as its own town. I was a big fan of the old Dansbury Depot, but after the fire it was replaced by Trackside Grill, which is fine, but more generic. In Stroudsburg I'm partial to the Sarah Street Grill but there are definitely a few decent options you have.\nCan we have a Dunder Mifflin thread? Man, do I miss that show.\nThanks for all of the great information. I am working with North Warren Regional HS. Sounds like I wait on Scranton until I head back that way next summer. Stroudsburg sounds like it’s got plenty of options. Warrior gave me some good insight.\nYes, an Office thread would be awesome. Currently binging Season 8 and 9 while waiting for my flight from GR to Newark.\nSeasons 1-3 were some of the funniest televison shows ever in my opinion.\nDinner Party was a great episode, too. I still have no idea how they ever filmed that scene when Michael was showing off his 12\" Flat Screen. Amazing how they kept straight faces. On the outtakes they just couldn't do it.\nThe amazing thing is The Office is alive and well. It's reborn to this high school and college generation.\nThere are two or 3 blocks downtown with a bunch of restaurants and bars. A place called Yard of Ale is pretty good (more of an upscale brew pub feel, but they don’t make their own beer), and there is a nice Irish pub a few doors down as well.\nRudy's Tavern in East Stroudsburg is a MUST!!!! Great bar food, and the bar bill won't bust your wallet! Log Cabin on Rte 46, just on the Jersey side of the Delaware is a great spot too!!!\nI wouldn't recommend Rudy's to a visitor looking to have a nice meal. Yeah the bar food is good, but it is more of a college, early twenties bar scene. $1 drafts and supers.\nI haven't visited the site much since the end of the season but just wanted to thank everyone for the suggestions.\nI stayed at the Hampton a couple of blocks from downtown so it was an easy walk to Happy Hour. Sampled several including Yard of Ale and then ended up at Siamsa Irish Pub for dinner.\nGreat area with great people on both side of the river. Maybe Hillsdale and the Warriors can hook up OOC sometime....or in the playoffs."

        "text": "When the DeKalb County School System(Decatur, GA) experienced rapid growth in the early 1990s, theexisting technology training program failed to keep pace, leavingmany instructors in the dark. Even though DeKalb spent nearly $1.6million each year to teach staff personal computer skills, only 8% ofthe population became competent in all the applications, whichincluded a word processor, database and spreadsheet. In the summer of1995, a committee met to discuss DeKalb's strategy for implementingnew technologies. A major goal was that teachers, students,administrators and parents would achieve a minimum proficiency in theuse of computers.\nForemost, committee members recognized a need toreach a greater number of teachers in a shorter amount of time.Secondly, they sought a method for training that would be readilyavailable at all times, since most instructors could not afford toleave their classrooms during the day. In addition, the method wouldhave to be self-paced, as group members would have varying levels ofknowledge and experience.\nThe solution came from Industrial TrainingCorp. (ITC), of Atlanta, Georgia. Partnering withAchieve, Inc., ITC supplied all the necessary courseware,facilitation and hotline support services required byDeKalb.\nThe training project began Sept. 25, 1995 at threeelementary schools: Austin, Hawthorne andMainstreet. Each of the original 108 participants received adesktop computer, which he or she could take home. An additional 60notebook computers supported off-site training. ITC'sPC-Skills Activ Learning Library solutions were loadedonto each machine.\nThe ITC package comprised Using PersonalComputers, Windows Basics and Intermediate, WordPerfect 6.1 Basics,PowerPoint 4.0 Basics, Excel 5.0 Basics and Microsoft AccessBasics.\nAfter 15 weeks of multimedia training, 83% of theparticipants believed they were competent in all the applications.Both novice and veteran teachers praised the new training method.\"This type of training is less intimidating than being in a regularclassroom where everyone knows when you don't know something,\" saidone teacher.\nThe second project, conducted in the spring 1996quarter, targeted administrative staff at 30 high schools. Trainingsessions were held in three labs at DeKalb's Rehoboth InstructionalCenter. The 550 participants ranged from principals andcounselors to bookkeepers and secretaries. Staff members weremandated to acquire 32 hours of personal computer training by the endof the fall quarter. Spending extra hours in the lab, many peoplecompleted their training in the spring rather than waiting until thenext school year.\nParticipants in both projects learned how tomaneuver the mouse and navigate through Windows. They also learnedhow to create, save, open, close, edit and print documents in all theapplication software. For the PowerPoint course, many teacherscreated slideshow presentations that they then used in theirclassrooms. And after the WordPerfect course, more staff membersstarted to produce memos, calendars and newsletters on theirPC.\nAs a result of these successful projects, DeKalb'ssuperintendent and board of education agreed to obtain and implement8,400 ITC courses throughout the school system andcommunity-at-large. The Basic Skills Library, forexample, addresses reading and writing, and suits adult literacyefforts, while the Technical Skills Library contains100 titles on electronics, pipefitting, troubleshooting, etc. forvocational training.\nThe training resources provide specific supportover a four-year period. As part of the plan, DeKalb will establishFamily Resource Centers at several sites to allowstudents and parents to learn side-by-side. Convinced that ITC'straining methods work, administrators hope that these centers willfoster life-long learning and help bridge the gap between schools andsurrounding communities."

        "text": "A brand image is the sum impression of a company’s “personality” in the minds of customers. It can be at the same time factual and imaginary. Brand image develops over time as a result of customers’ cumulative experience across numerous touch points. A strong brand image results in an overall favorable impression of the company and its products and services and fosters a sense of trust.\nA common misconception is that brand creation involves designing a great logo, a smart marketing plan, or well-crafted communications materials and advertising. It’s true, these are essential to a strong brand image but don’t do the entire job in and of themselves. Consumers are smart. Telling them how great your products are doesn’t work. The old model of big corporations forcing brands into the market is over. With the advent of the Internet and social media, consumers now have a much greater influence in the market.\nWhat is my unique proposition and what is it that makes my company or products relevant and desirable?\nHow can I offer value that my competitors don’t?\nWhat promises and commitments can I make to them and am willing to stand behind?\nWhat values am I committed to and for what do I want to be known?\nDefine these carefully and apply them consistently. Let these values guide every decision you make. Make sure everyone in your organization understands them and keeps them top-of-mind. Your brand values should permeate your entire culture—from your annual report to the way the receptionist answers the phone.\nIn ‘n Out Burger is a strong brand built mostly on word-of-mouth. The company does very little advertising but became very successful by understanding who they are and never deviating from their core brand values. They offer high quality, simple food at a reasonable price. They keep their menu limited, choosing to do a few things very well and consistently delivering a quality product. This simple approach separates them from competitors who continuously update their menus. Customers trust them to provide a uniform experience no matter what location they visit. The result is a customer base that is fiercely loyal. They have learned what their customers expect and work hard to provide it consistently.\nA brand never becomes strong by trying to be all things to all people. Define for whom your product or service is intended and focus on them. Know who your ideal customers are and make an effort to understand their particular needs and desires. What problems will you solve for them? Can you make their lives better? How will you engage with them? How can you give them a more substantial stake in your company and include them in your culture?\nCreating personas can make it easier to visualize your customers as real people, understand their needs, and appeal to them emotionally as well as intellectually.\nToday, customers are in the driver’s seat. Your business will thrive or fail based on whether or not they feel an affinity for your brand and what it offers them. At the very least you’ll want to develop a deep understanding of who they are, what they value, and how best to communicate with them.\nTrust is the foundation of a strong brand. To earn that trust you must prove yourself trustworthy. Always be honest with your customers. Always tell the truth—not what you want them to hear. If you make a mistake, own it. Mistakes are never good, but by attempting to cover them up, you may lose your customers’ trust and never get it back. Customers can forgive mistakes if you admit them and do your best to make them right.\nRecently, Volkswagen installed software in many of their diesel cars designed to falsify emission test to make them appear to run cleaner. After it was exposed to the public, brand analysis by Gallup revealed that 4 out of 10 consumers were much less likely to buy a Volkswagen in the future. While the company has since admitted the transgression and has apologized, that betrayal of their customers’ hard-earned trust has tarnished their brand image. It could take many years to regain the loyalty that was lost.\nOne of the worst things you can do is imitate a more successful competitor. It may be tempting to ride on the coattails of their success, but that won’t get you very far. Chances are, those companies are successful because they identified and leveraged their unique strengths. You should do the same. The key to making your brand stand out is not imitation but differentiation. In the same way that no two people are exactly alike, companies have qualities that make them unique. Identify yours and build on them.\nDevelop a voice and visual style in your communications that is uniquely yours—one that matches your company’s “personality” and values. In addition to a great logo and tagline, establish a unique tone of voice in your writing and be consistent in the use of typography, colors, and images. It’s always a good idea to hire a brand specialist to guide you through this process and create a visual “vocabulary” that is all your own. Avoid using stock images when possible. It can be very confusing to your customers if your competitor happens to use the same photos or illustrations as you—and it does happen. Creating a library of custom images to be used for multiple purposes makes good branding sense and may even save money in the long run.\nWe’ve established that every brand has unique qualities. Each brand also has a story all its own. It might include your company history but, most importantly, it should describe your vision. Take some time to write yours and use it as a basis for all your brand communications. If you have a clear story, it will be easier for customers to understand and relate to you. A good brand story will make it easier for them to care about what you have to offer and become emotionally invested.\nThe term story, however, can be a bit misleading. It’s not a narrative to publish and distribute, although there may be times this would be appropriate. Instead, it’s a conceptual thread woven through every communication your company has with the public whether it’s from your website, blog, literature, product packaging or from the lips of your sales or support personnel.\nFinally, while your story is about your brand, the focus should be on your customers and how they benefit from what you provide for them. Good branding is a partnership between you and your customers.\nStarbucks is an example of a great brand story. It started with a commitment to great tasting gourmet coffee but developed over time into something much more. Many other companies were selling good coffee, but Starbucks noticed early on the difference between American coffee shops and the coffee culture in Europe which centers around small espresso bars. These are not only places to get great coffee but are social hubs as well. With this in mind, they set out to make Starbucks not only a great coffee bar but a community as well. The products, furnishings, music, and décor were all designed to provide delightful customer experiences for a young, hip demographic. The story is less about the company than the experience it provides.\nLet’s face it. Grabbing attention in our communication-saturated culture is a challenge. According to Yankovich Consumer Research, the average person sees or hears as many as 5,000 marketing messages per day. That’s a lot of competition! To have any hope of being noticed, you must have a compelling message and convey it as simply as possible. Today, any message that requires more than a moment to absorb will likely be overlooked. In branding, it’s axiomatic that less is more.\nThere’s a lot you could say about your products but don’t try to say too much. While they may have a host of great attributes, the only ones that matter are those that make your customers’ lives better. For example, think of all the amazing technology and programming that went into creating Apple’s SIRI. Detailing the technical intricacies that went into the product might be interesting to some, but to the average consumer, it’s irrelevant. All that matters to them is that they can ask their phone a question and get a quick, helpful answer. Focus on the features that benefit the customer most and save everything else for the technical documents.\nTo say a picture is worth a thousand words may sound cliché, but it’s absolutely true. Research confirms that we remember visual images more easily than words. Using photos or illustrations to tell a story can be more effective than writing. Most people are lazy readers. If something looks like an effort to read, people will often move on. A picture, on the other hand, can be processed by the brain almost immediately. What’s more, images can have an emotional appeal that doesn’t come across as readily with words alone.\nGreat images can send implicit messages about a product’s quality or reinforce a brand’s personality. Apple does an excellent job of using quality images to enhance the perceived value of their products and, by extension, their brand.\nAccording to Psychology Today, while most people believe they make purchasing decisions based on rational analysis, in reality, most choices are heavily influenced by emotion. Strong brands appeal to customers on an emotional level as well as a rational one.\nIn fact, shoppers are often willing to pay more for a name brand product even when there is a cheaper generic alternative with the same features. Most purchases are made at a subconscious level and not always for practical reasons. A woman may be more likely to buy a pair of shoes because she thinks they will make her look attractive than because she believes them to be well made. A man may choose a BMW over a Toyota because he believes it will make him appear more successful even though either would fulfill the practical need of getting him from home to the office.\nThe most successful brands create a powerful connection to the consumer by appealing to their emotional needs whether they be greed, desire, social acceptance, envy, fear or altruism. People are less interested in what a product can do than what it can do for them. If, as a brand, you tell your story in a way that resonates emotionally and fulfills a customer’s basic needs, you will be much more likely to develop a long-term relationship of trust and loyalty.\nThe Internet and social media have revolutionized the way the world communicates much like the printing press did in the 15th century. Upwards of 60% of Americans use social media multiple times each day—and that number is growing fast. Over the last decade, business communications have changed fundamentally. Technology has made it possible to have ongoing dialogs with customers, and they increasingly expect it. The advantage of social media over traditional advertising is the opportunity to engage with your customers rather than merely pitch to them. When a customer feels like they’re being listened to rather than talked at, they will be more likely to feel an affinity with your brand.\nWhen using social media, it’s important to provide customers with information that is useful and relevant. Convey information that is so engaging people will want to share it. Make an effort to foster dialog. It’s not enough to push information out. Make sure you reply to comments, ask questions and do whatever you can to make users feel like they have a voice and that their voice matters to you.\nSome companies, like Apple, have been successful creating products that people need before they know they need them. Most successful products, however, are a response to an existing need. The days of creating a product and forcing it into the marketplace are gone. Savvy companies today listen to their customers and develop products that solve real problems for them. Customers expect to have a voice, so why not use social media to give them a hand in product development? Try using surveys or contests to solicit their input as to design, colors, and features. Use that information to guide your product design and brand messaging. By the time you launch your product, many of your customers will already be invested.\nYou don’t necessarily need to have a presence on all social media platforms. Focus on those that are most appropriate for your particular brand. For example, LinkedIn is great for B2B. Instagram is a logical choice if your brand is inherently visual. Pinterest is ideal for brands related to fashion or other products directed at women. Due to its immediacy, Twitter may be the best way to keep your audience up to date on breaking news, product updates, promotions and to offer coupons and discounts to reward loyal customers. Facebook is a must for horizontal markets because it has over a billion users worldwide and its demographics are broad and varied.\nFinally, write content that is relevant, friendly and conversational. Whatever platform you choose, be sure to post material that is consistent with your brand’s strategy, personality and values and is uniform in tone and voice.\nYour brand image is everything. Like a garden, it requires constant tending—but can become unhealthy through neglect. However, by paying close attention to how you present your brand and the quality of customer engagement at each customer touch point, your brand will become stronger and flourish over time."

You may think that just because a particular thing has never caused damage in your home that it won’t suddenly decide to do so. Even the safest of homes have their dangers. Because of this, it’s not necessarily about stopping the dangers, it’s about dealing with them in the right ways. This could be the difference between you staying safe and you putting yourself, and your family in danger.\nFirst and foremost, when it comes to danger hotspots in the home, like with your electrics, you should leave any faults to be dealt with by a professional home electrician. Unless you are a trained and qualified electrician you should never try to fix an electrical fault. Yes, it is important to know where the main switch is so that you can turn everything off in an emergency. But this doesn’t mean you should know the ins and outs of your electrics. And it certainly doesn’t mean you should take to tampering with them yourself. Electricity can kill if it is treated in the wrong ways, and that should never be forgotten.\nSomething else that can kill if treated in the wrong ways is the ‘silent’ killer that is carbon monoxide. To treat this in the right way you should again seek help from a professional. In this case a qualified technician should be sought so that they can check out all the hotspots in your home that could potentially omit poisonous carbon monoxide fumes. But the need to treat this very real, and very serious plight in the right way doesn’t stop there. You should purchase a CO detector so that you can be alerted in the future to any potential hazardous fumes in your home. You should also try to refrain from heating your home with a gas oven.\nThere are a host of hidden dangers in your home, most of which can be quashed if you treat them in the right way. And when it comes to treating these dangers you should never be tentative to have to spend to do so. It’s all well and good saving money, but you should never try to save money if doing so puts your health and wellbeing at risk. You are far more important than money ever will be. So, the next time you have to decide between a coffee from Starbucks or a detector for your home, please go with the latter and not the latte!\nWhen danger arises in your home you need to deal with it in the right way. You need to have it tended to by professionals. You need to do all you can to ensure that the danger never arises again. Choosing the right way to deal with things is crucial. As previously mentioned it could be the difference between your safety and danger. Quite extremely, it could be the difference between life and death."

        "text": "The lines between sports, media and gaming are becoming increasingly blurred. At their epicentre lies esports and their rapid convergence is driving the growth of sports gaming at a blistering pace. Already boasting professional athletes, eye-watering sponsorship deals and a global audience of over 350 million viewers, the popularity of esports is skyrocketing and is now even being considered for the Olympic Games. The cross-over of sports, media and gaming is forming the bedrock of the industry to come and will influence its trajectory into the future, creating a host of new career opportunities and business challenges.\nThe first glimpses of an entwined sports and esports future can already be seen. Earlier this year, Manchester City signed its second FIFA esports player and Aston Villa partnered with TalkTalk to broadcast its newly launched esports league, whilst a major feature of Tottenham Hotspur’s new stadium is its capacity for hosting esports matches. Traditional sports organisations fuelling the growth of esports is a trend gaining momentum around the world. Over 20 million players competed for a spot at this years’ FIFA eWorld Cup and McLaren has launched its own esports talent programme. The National Basketball Association (NBA), capitalising on the success of the first season of its esports league has announced a second, complete with housing and salaries for the players and the National Football League (NFL) is following hot on its heels as it looks to appoint a Head of Esports.\nWith major sporting associations and teams committing to sports gaming, esports are becoming increasingly professionalised. Sporting associations and sports teams are focusing on esports as a profitable brand vehicle – West Ham recently appointed an esports partner as its sleeve sponsor – and with the monetization of the industry, competitive esports are rapidly resembling traditional sports. Injuries, doping scandals and pay disputes materialise in the same way they do in traditional sports, while players are trained physically to ensure fast cognitive reactions and the same competing age time-lines impact esportsmen and women just as much as they do traditional athletes.\nThe events themselves mirror those of traditional sports with Blizzard’s first Overwatch League Championships achieving maximum capacity at the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn whilst 300,000 viewers streamed the finals online. With 125 million gamers alone playing the third-person shooter Fortnite, the popularity of gaming offers an untapped audience for organisations to capitalise on.\nThe media’s role in cultivating the industry is patently clear and has successfully shaped the image of competitive gaming into a professional sport, in part, by catering to millennial viewing habits. Audience numbers for Match of the Day are increasing as a new generation of viewers favour shorter highlights over ninety minute games; almost five million viewers tuned in to the first Match of the Day of the season last year. On the other hand, viewing figures for live coverage of the Premier League continues to decline with millennial viewers courting alternative media platforms such as Snapchat to watch highlights of games.\nEsports games are shorter and faster-paced than their real-world counterparts, ideal for the primary audience of time-precious millennials. Understanding the shift in behaviour, media giants such as ESPN have launched dedicated esports channels while last year the BBC began live coverage of esports games. Data is at the heart of this and media providers are utilising the analytics from their subscriber networks to drive viewer engagement and target consumers with greater accuracy. Amazon, who owns esports streaming channel Twitch TV, will also soon livestream 20 Premier League matches on Amazon Prime. The online retailer will take advantage of its many-tentacled network and Amazon Prime subscribers who view sports matches and purchase sports video games can expect to be targeted with adverts for live esports.\nAs the sports, media and gaming industries continue to blend into one another we can expect to see an increasing overlap of roles that has to some extent, already begun. Most recently, former UFC Brand Officer and ex-CEO of Manchester City Football Club Gary Cook, took up the role of Executive Chairman at UK based e-sports organiser Gfinity. The year before, Gfinity hired Mark Brittain, a former executive at TV production firm Syco, in an attempt to replicate popular sports and talent shows. With competitive gaming becoming increasingly mainstream, esports teams, leagues and associations are fishing for talent from a wider source than just the gaming recruitment pool. The transfer of skills is already coming from traditional sports and media as esports organisations look to tap into the entertainment industry, build themselves as major brands and harness sponsorship deals.\nLooking to the future, the opportunities are many and varied. More and more teams are going to need managers to negotiate pay and handle sponsorship opportunities, while bourgeoning esports leagues will need talent coaches to nurture esports ‘superstars’. At present, the World Esports Association has been formed to standardise pay and rights within the industry, but regulation covering gambling, match-fixing and doping is still relatively light on the ground. What’s more, the wide variety of esports games means individual regulatory bodies for each esport are likely to be formed, creating a demand for governance and compliance skills that is more than likely to be met by the sports industry.\nThe growing business of professional video gaming is being defined by its trilateral roots in sports media and gaming as organisations within these industries see the lucrative opportunities its future holds. These landscapes will continue to merge and individuals will increasingly permeate across each industry so that soon, sports and esports will not look too dissimilar from one another.\nFor further information please contact Bambos Eracleous.\nI wonder if the physical and psychological pressures facing players will result in esports nutritional and mental well-being programmes, as per more traditional sports? Interesting that the first esports player to sign for Man City has taken time out this year to 're-focus'."

Additionally, she serves as a thought-partner to the executive team to define, refine and communicate the Ironwood story.\nAs Ironwood kicked off 2016, the company had outgrown its science-heavy, startup-focused story frame and needed to better emphasize the unmet needs it was serving and the significant commercial capabilities it was leveraging to do so, including its award-winning marketing team and national sales force. Working closely with the CEO and the executive team, Morrison co-led the process of reframing Ironwood’s story as a commercial biotechnology company, advancing its key franchises in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation/chronic idiopathic constipation, refractory GERD and vascular/fibrotic disease.\nThe revised messaging and related materials debuted at the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in January 2016—biotech’s largest investor conference—and feedback from investors, analysts and Ironwood’s Board of Directors was positive. Moreover, these key messages carried through positively in the subsequent media placements—including the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Boston Globe, and myriad trade publications, including a cover story in Life Science Leader—that Ironwood secured. Outreach around this effort has garnered nearly 250 million impressions year-to-date."

        "text": "No matter how big or small your budget maybe in college, every student can benefit from the savings found at thrift stores. Here is my list of 7 Things College Students Should Buy at Thrift Stores that will help save you some cash.\nI cannot stress this one enough. In college, I had lots of nice shirts, dress shirts, polos, and more. Eventually, I decided I would rather be comfortable in that 3-hour long physics class than wear a dress shirt. T-shirts quickly became my friend. They are cheap, light weight, and no tear will be shed if something accidentally happened to the $3 shirt instead of that nice J.Crew $90 dress shirt.\nAt most thrift stores including the bigger national stores such as Goodwill and Salvation Army, one can find wonderful t-shirts for $3-$5 a piece. Over the years I have picked up many awesome graphic shirts, sports shirts for my teams, and even an occasional wrestling t-shirt. Yes, I am a wrestling fan.\nShirts at thrift stores tend to be very cheap allowing money to be spent on additional items.\nWhen searching for shirts, remember to check each shirt for stains, tears, holes, and rips. Even though you are buying these shirts for their cheap use factor, there is no reason to buy a damaged item when there are usually so many other shirts on the racks.\nBy hitting the thrift stores often, my friends and I were able to stock up on cheap shirts, and such a large amount of shirts, we were able to put off doing laundry for much longer periods. After all who wants to be stuck doing laundry during their college days when there are so many other cool things going on?\nWhat was said above about t-shirts also applies to pants and jeans. That chemistry lab class, while almost always safe, does have the potential to stain or trash your clothes. Keep those AG or Levi jeans nice for when you go out on the town and wear that cheap $5-$9 thrift store find to class.\nFor dress pants and khakis I would try to always hit the thrift stores first. For me, the retail brands I liked on sale would run around $50 to $60 a pair. At thrift stores, when I find them I would pay between $6 and $8 a pair. For the price of one on sale retail pair of pants, I could buy a weeks worth at the thrift stores. The key was hitting the thrift stores often and searching the racks.\nPants & Jeans can be purchased at thrift stores for a small fraction of retail costs.\nAs with shirts, be sure to check each pair of pants for stains, rips, tears, or holes, unless they were designed that way. For jeans also check the pockets for holes, bent fasteners that may cut, and the zipper is functional.\nSince you are buying t-shirts and pants at the thrift store you should swing over to the accessories section and do a little shopping. Belts, ties, scarfs, hats, bags, purses, and vintage jewelry are always in stock and often overlooked. I have found more high dollar accessories at almost free prices more than any other wardrobe item. For men, a mid range classy leather belt can easily run $50. At a thrift store that belt might be only $5 and in near new condition.\nBooks sections at thrift stores are cheap resources for textbooks and reference materials.\nYeah, I know, we all have smart phones and other tech gadgets. Books are like so 1990s and before. However, thrift stores in the town of your college may end up getting copies of text books for courses you take. Sometimes, they are off by a single edition. In some cases, this is not an issue because it may only contain very minor error corrections or simply updated cover art. Some new editions of books are released just to outdate the previous edition so people are forced into buying new books when the professors require the latest edition. This did happen for a few of my classes. Bought the 9th edition of an engineering book for $10 when the 10th edition with different cover art was over $120.\nFor English classes, philosophy, and any other course that has a wide range of written work that can be used, I cannot stress thrift stores enough. I had a philosophy course on the theory of knowledge. I was able to find a handful of books at the local thrift stores related to the course materials for a few bucks. If it was not for one of those books, I would not have been able to do well in the latter half of the semester in that class.\nDishware can be bought at discount retailers at cheap prices. Amazon runs great deals all the time. Going these routes you are guaranteed new items that all match. If getting items with character, retro or vintage looks, thrift stores are the way to go. You will always be able to find something, just don’t expect to find full matching sets.\nFor cookware stainless steel with copper bottoms are good. A cast iron skillet is a must have in any kitchen. Try to find pots with lids. In some stores lids, pots, and pans get separated so be sure to check to see what goes with what before making a purchase. If you do choose to buy a new set of cookware, AmazonBasics 2-piece fry pan set is a great deal.\nLow-cost cookware and bakeware such as these Pyrex dishes can be found at thrift stores.\nOther cookware such as mixing bowls and baking dishes are also cheaper at thrift stores when compared to retail. Two brands that I recommend shopping for are Corningware and Pyrex if you can find them at the thrift stores.\nWhen mixing dishes of different brands try to stick to similar sizes and shapes so they will stack more easily in your cabinets. Avoid chipped, nicked, cracked, glued, or damaged dishes. Don’t buy scratched and damaged non-stick cookware.\nMicrowaves, George Foreman grills, coffee makers, toaster ovens, blenders, slow cookers, and table top grills could all be found within the first few dorm rooms on any floor in any of the dormitories on my universities campus. In other words, college students live off these appliances. Throw in the waffle maker, a breakfast sandwich maker, the local pizza delivery number, and the need for a stove and oven is no more. All of these items can be found at thrift stores that carry small appliances. You may have to visit a few stores to get most of them, but you can save a load of cash fast when compared to these items at full retail.\nSmall kitchen appliances can be found at thrift stores for prices that are 25% to 90% less than retail.\nIf you are more of a foodie or the weekend chef who has an off campus apartment with a real kitchen, you can get more luxury appliances such as upright stand mixers at a heavy discount too.\nAlso, don’t forget about small vacuum cleaners. New vacuums can be very pricey, a cheap older model high brand cleaner can be found at thrift stores. Be sure to check for appliances yard sales. People who remodel their homes and replace carpets with wood floors or tile have no need for the $300 Dyson cleaner and you can usually negotiate a great deal.\nSo you have a new place or dorm. It may have a bed, shelf, and desk if you are lucky. But what about a table and some chairs? A couch? TV stand? Well, you can go to the furniture store and spend hundred or thousands of dollars. Or you can go to thrift stores and yard sales and save a small fortune. Check Facebook and join the local area yard sale groups to watch for yard sales with furniture.\nChairs are just one of many pieces of furniture one can find for reasonable prices at thrift stores.\nI had bought two new pieces furniture when I moved into my new home, a couch and a love seat. After 3 years they were falling apart and for the price I paid, let me say I was not happy. I decided to go and buy a cheap set at one of the discount retail store chains for a few hundred dollars. They lasted about 2 years before they were falling apart. Having decided I am not wasting any more money, I started hitting the thrift stores with my mother. We found a La-Z-Boy couch and love seat set at only $75 per piece. For $150 I just replaced the two most expensive pieces of furniture in my living room. While the design is something out of the early 1990s, it fits quite well with my decor and they are very sturdy and very comfortable.\nAs the start of the college year approaches it is never too early or too late to start hitting up the thrift stores to save some cash.\nRemember to always thoroughly check items before purchase for any damage or issues that may affect its functionality or safety.\nGood luck in your hunt for college savings. Let me know what else you shop for at thrift stores for your college dorm or housing on Twitter or Facebook."

        "text": "The Arches Glasgow, every Friday night for a long time... you can't beat it !!!\nThis is a Kraken of a tune, Duttey tech house at its best.\nOne of my personal classics. This is a record that will never leave my collection. Absolute monster.\nDARK FORCES, arguably the best track off Slam's debut album, gets the remix treatment here, and Claude Young is on the job for a harder mix, which doesn't differ greatly melodically, but messes around with the percussion some and adds an interesting interlude. Kenny Larkin also plays with the rhythms some while maintaining the original riff, though the track shifts into its own being 1/3 of the way through. With the b-sides, \"Sick Organ\" offers an off-kilter tech track with plenty of angular melodies to keep the ears intrigued, while \"Plastic Jazz\" goes on a shiny tech-house kick. Not much jazz, but plenty of Detroitian groove.\nOnce you have heard Dark Forces you won't forget it. It's a deep track that is very of the period and hasn't aged the best but it never fails to bring back memories. Probobly Slam's best track after 1994 and one of Soma's least known but most unforgetable techno monsters. Minimal workhorse and good remixes."

        "text": "Ahhhhh ... Sundays .... my favourite day of the week! Busy day yesterday - both little girls had dancing lessons, family lunch date, shopping, and my oldest daughter's second game of her indoor soccer playoffs (they've won both games in the playoffs so far!). I'm hoping the pace is a little slower today - one daughter is going to a birthday party, and another daughter wants to have some friends over. I think we'll make some pretty head bands with her friends. I'm also working on a new set of cootie catchers (money). I'm making a set with American coins and a set with Canadian coins.\nAnyhow, I digress ... today is about math journals. I almost didn't get a math journal in this week ... almost ... but I found some time during our math block on Friday afternoon, and we spent the last 1/2 hour making a new foldable for our journals ... we were cutting it pretty close!!!\nWe used the same multiplication question for all the strategies (32 x 21) so students could see using various strategies will still result in the same answer.\nWell, that's about it for today. I'm excited to have my Earth Day Report Card in the TPT newsletter today! Don't forget I have a 15% off sale at both my TPT store and my TN store - sale runs until tomorrow. If you get a chance, stop by my sister's blog, Meet the Dubiens. She has a FABULOUS bento box giveaway going on right now. And ... one last thing ... tomorrow is a very special day for my blog - tomorrow is my one year blogoversary. You've got to stop by and see what SURPRISE I've planned for you!\nGreat use of the foldable!!! So nice to break up the examples!\nLove it! I always look forward to your math journal posts!\nIf I could have a \"Do Over\" for this year, it would be to do Math Journals.\nWe did a few, but not enough to have a routine.\nYour posts have given me the inspiration to do this better next year--starting in September.\nI have shared your math journal ideas with my fellow 3-5 teachers. Thanks for sharing!\nDO YOU USE A BINDER WITH PAPER OR A NOTEBOOK FOR YOUR NOTEBOOKING? I AM GOING TO START DOING THIS NEXT YEAR, THANKS!\nThank-you! My students use a notebook for their math journals. I use binder paper when I made the models for the students, and I store them all in a binder so when a student is absent, he or she can borrow my model and complete their own.\nI am addicted to Math journals. They truly make Math more meaningful to the students. Thank you for sharing and adding ideas to the mix. You are a Math guru!\nI used your idea for the multiplication foldable with my fifth graders today. They had been having difficulty with the concept of multiplication . Your box model was a hit. I have never seen it done in this way and so when we went over it, the concept took. My kids did not want to stop doing multiplication! Thank you for sharing!"

        "text": "=The government has decided to amend its contract with Siemens to establish a wind energy stations with a capacity of 2000 MW and investments worth €2bn to operate according to the build, own, operate (BOO) system instead of the EBC Finance system.\nGovernment sources told Daily News Egypt that the Germany company has started negotiations with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC) and the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) regarding the tariff to sell the electricity produced from the stations planned to be launched. An agreement was reached on the tariff to be less than 3.8 cents for each kWh.\nThe sources added that German Siemens will start implementing two phases of the projects whose capacity is estimated to be 2,000 MW, as it is establishing a station with a capacity of 180 MW in Ras Gharib, and another in Suez Gulf with capacity of 650 MW.\nThe sources explained that the negotiations are ongoing to purchase the energy planned to be produced with a capacity of 830 MW, in addition to discussion regarding the rest of the capacities with a capacity of 1,170 MW.\nThe sources said that the government has strong bonds with the German company, and the proof is the company’s responsiveness to the request of the holding company regarding amending the contractual system of the project.\nSiemens has completed launching three traditional electricity plants with a capacity of 14.400 MW worth €6bn, which is a low value compared to the technology and fuel available and produced by the plants, however, the company’s desire to implement projects and cooperate with Egypt has not stood in the way of completing the contract and adhering to the timetable.\nThe sources expected the agreement with Siemens to be concluded and the contracts to be signed to establish the wind energy stations before the end of this year, especially that the German company has received the land and carried out studies and calculations at the location of the project in Ras Gharib and Suez Gulf.\nEven though the New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) has sought to agree with banking bodies to manage funding the first phase of the project with 180 MW capacity and investments of €180m, the lack of liquidity in the EETC has prevented this.\nThe EEHC signed an agreement with Siemens in 2015 during the economic conference in Sharm El Sheikh to establish wind energy stations with capacities of 2000 MW.\nEgypt is planning to generate 20% renewable energy of the total produced amounts by 2022. Egypt’s current Energy production is estimated to be 44,000 MW, including about 2,400 MW produced from water, accounting for 5.5% of the amount, in addition to 1000 MW from wind energy, and 170 MW from solar energy—an equivalent of 2.6%.\nThe sources pointed out that the awaited projects will be implemented with the BOO system and investors will implement and fund, and the EETC will purchase the energy produced from the project."

        "text": "Lynn Blake, left, teaches two hospital employees CPR at the VVMC Safety Fair. Blakeâs passion for educating Eagle County residents came from her own Sudden Cardiac Arrest, which a bystander provided CPR and saved her life. She was just 27 at the time.\nOn Valentine’s Day 2007, Lynn Blake was embarking on a new job in Vail Village when she had a rude awakening. The 27-year-old suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Fortunately for her, someone trained in CPR stepped forward and kept her heart beating until emergency personnel arrived with a defibrillator. If someone dropped in front of you unconscious, with no notable pulse, would you know what to do? Some 325,000 people die every year of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the United States. And, contrary to popular belief, it strikes people of all ages. “I did not know a thing about cardiac arrest. I didn’t know what it was,” Blake said. Now she knows firsthand about sudden cardiac arrest. The more she found out, the more she wondered why more people weren’t educated about SCA, the leading causes of death in the U.S. Just a few months after Blake’s sudden cardiac arrest, area pro biker Mike Janelle, in the prime of his life, died of SCA.”It’s a lot more common than people realize,” Blake said. Yet, she found, “no one’s really educating people about cardiac arrest.” That’s why she founded the Starting Hearts Foundation, partnering with the Vail Valley Medical Center and area emergency services. Starting Hearts is a non-profit dedicated to saving the lives of SCA victims, through communitywide CPR and AED (Automated External Defibrillation) education and access. “Vail Valley Medical Center embraces Lynn’s mission,” said Doris Kirchner, CEO and president of Vail Valley Medical Center. “VVMC is in the business of saving lives, and Starting Hearts can have a direct impact on that mission by engaging the community to help recognize and react to SCA appropriately.” Community key to saving lives Nearly 60 percent of cardiac arrests are witnessed. Most people know to call 911. But if that’s all you know about saving someone from SCA, the victim’s chance of surviving is slim.
